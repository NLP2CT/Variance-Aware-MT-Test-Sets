Dozens of patient reports are hanging from the ceiling of the Project Room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
It is a many-year examination period, including meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and physicians.
The process starts with a referral to diagnose a gender identity disorder. These diagnoses are performed in Tampere and Helsinki.
The Act on the Legal Recognition of the Gender of Transsexuals (563/2002), or the trans act, obligates transgender people to a compulsory sterilisation so that their correct gender can be registered, for example, in the Population Register Centre and their passport.
Currently, each person about to change their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of their inability to reproduce.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight concerns regarding the act, and the European Court of Human Rights has a precedent that obligates parties to the European Convention of Human Rights to adhere to the right of self-determination.
The former Government of Finland prepared the amendments to the act under Susanne Huovinen, the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
The front of the exhibition area is dominated by two large installations.
One of these is made of the packages and instructions of medicinal products used by Auer.
"It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill", Auer says.
What was even more shocking was that Auer was not given access to gender reassignment surgery.
According to the nursing staff, she did not have sufficient resources to start the process.
Her own identity was denied from her.
"It's crazy that anyone defined as a woman at birth can have their breasts enlarged. But, to have breasts removed altogether, a diagnosis is needed", Auer says.
For many, a gender reassignment process is tougher mentally than physically as a result of medical operations.
Anyone who undergoes the process meets dozens of people to whom they must explain their existence and right to a gender identity.
By appealing to these, the nursing staff can decide that the process cannot be started.
Auer's personal exhibit also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
She was finally able to put into words the feelings she had had since her childhood and teenage –
Being seen is a basic need.
However, in the first phases of the process, random comments by people close to her hurt.
What hurts me the most is when people close to me define my gender incorrectly.
However, not all transgender people want physical alterations.
Without the use of hormones or a lengthy examination process, it is not possible to have an official status for one's own gender.
"There is no medical basis for these examinations", Auer says.
For example, in Denmark, Parliament approved a new procedure for identifying the legal gender in June 2014.
After a reconsideration period of six months, the applicant needs to confirm their application in writing, after which the ministry will provide the applicant with a new personal identity code.
A similar right of self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and this is also what characterises Auer's exhibition.

Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to clarify the CEO's additional pension
Yle reports that Mika Lintilä (Centre Party), Minister of Economic Affairs in charge of Government ownership steering, has asked Finnair to clarify the additional pension paid to CEO Pekka Vauramo.
Vauramo's additional pension of EUR 130,000 hit the news this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the development on incentives paid to directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's additional pension in February.
The state holds more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, this decision is in line with last year's decision-in-principle on ownership steering.
Sanctions immediately resulted in heated talks
When meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Donald Trump, the President of the USA, and Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, seemed to get along nicely.
Russia showed a bitter response to the new economic sanctions approved last week by the US Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
So far, the most stunning response has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev who said that the sanctions bill signed by Trump will result in a "full-scale trade war."
Even if the Russian responses were shrugged off merely as exaggerations and aggravations belonging to political rhetoric, the increased tension between the USA and Russia is a fact, following the short honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the USA, passing the sanctions act concerning Russia, Iran and North Korea was no simple process.
Then again, the US Congress was remarkably unanimous in passing the bill. However, it was told that accepting the bill was much more difficult for the president.
After a short honeymoon, the relationship between the USA and Russia has turned decidedly colder.
Such a situation is in no sense a preferable one.
For a member state such as Finland that trades frequently with Russia, economic sanctions are a constant nuisance.
The impact of the new US sanctions act remains unclear.
Another cause of sourness in Europe is that liquefied natural gas, which is important for US finances, has been excluded from the sanctions.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and accurate,
Is nothing sacred?
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
Yeah, I think it went well.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
But he did not silence his critics.
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
But it matters.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
Polygamy is common here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
"What else could we do?"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were set to fight at Hartwall Arena on 27 May.

Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.

The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.

EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars, while it aims to hold on to its exclusive position.
All measles cases in eastern Savonia caused by a single virus type
The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) announced that the measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same virus type as the previous cases in eastern Savonia.
In the light of this information, all infections in eastern Savonia are related to the first measles infection discovered in the area in June.
No new measles infections or suspicions of new cases have been discovered after the fifth case.

Finland is getting ready to make legal kilju
Preparing kilju, a traditional homemade Finnish alcoholic beverage, will be legal next year, while making moonshine legal will not even be considered.
Kilju is prepared through fermentation, while moonshine is made by means of distillation.
When the ministry originally prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, making the distillation of moonshine legal was not even considered.
"We didn't talk about making distillation legal", says Member of Parliament Outi Mäkelä (National Coalition Party).
She is in the negotiation team of parliamentary groups of parties represented in the Government that discussed the reform of the Alcohol Act.
In addition, its commercial production will remain subject to a licence.
The Government wanted to make the regulations governing alcohol simpler.
"Making kilju is no longer a problem related to national health in Finland", Tuominen says.
A much larger change took place in 2004 when any restrictions on importing alcohol from Estonia and other EU states were removed.
As much as 75 per cent of all alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is currently being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be discussed in Parliament when the autumn term starts.
It's like Parliament had taken a stand", Mäkelä says.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to hospital with an escort of armed guards
Suffering from chest pain, Oscar Pistorius was rushed to a South African hospital with a suspected heart attack.
Pistorius has already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence at the Atteridgeville prison.
The British Mirror newspaper reports that Pistorius was taken to the hospital this morning escorted by armed guards.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time Paralympic gold medallist to six years of imprisonment for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
The scene begins again.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."

Neymar bought out of Barcelona – the Brazilian star signed a five-year deal with PSG
Earlier in Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the release fee of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona playing in the Spanish Primera División.
The incredible transfer fee of EUR 222 million is the highest fee ever paid in the history of football.
The earlier record was held by Manchester United which paid EUR 105 million for French Paul Pogba last summer.
The Primera División froze the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment attempted by Neymar's representatives.
In practice, PSG paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who, through the Primera División, forwarded the funds to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be presented to his new home crowd at PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA to investigate the details
In a press release, Barcelona announced that it will send information about the fee to the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) so that it can define any disciplinary actions resulting from the transfer.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will have an impact on the club's finances for several years, but this impact cannot be evaluated beforehand.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned company from Qatar.

Austin, 21, badly burnt by lightning – flash recorded by airport security camera
Austin Dunn was performing regular maintenance on an airplane at Southwest Florida International Airport with two of his colleagues when the plane was suddenly struck by lightning.
The power of the lightning threw Dunn, who was working near the wing, to the ground.
Dunn was rushed to hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
I just asked if he's still alive", Austin's sister Autumn says.
In addition to burns, he suffered muscle damage and cerebral bleeding.
According to a representative of the airport, the lightning warning system was on at the time of the accident, and forwarding companies can independently decide whether or not to follow it.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
According to the suspects, their intention was to plant the bomb on a plane on 15 July, but their attempt failed before the security checkpoint.
Michael Phelan, a deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, says that this was one of the most professional plans ever witnessed in Australia.
Due to the plans of suspected terrorists, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company reached good results in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products were record high and the net sales of the Marketing & Services segment developed positively.
Last year, the comparative operating profit increased as a result of the US Blenders Tax Credit tax concession.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained high this year as a result of higher sales volumes and favourable market conditions, even after the discontinuation of the tax concession.
"We are making good progress in terms of our strategy.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
I want to come down to lightweight.
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
"We're the main names.
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
It will be a great fight."
Average monthly salary EUR 5,300, regardless of education – the "Wild West" of investment advisors
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat wrote about Ritva, 68, to whom an investment advisor of a banking firm talked complete nonsense when selling investment products.
Regulations governing investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
These are based on the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive which will be applied starting from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the evaluation of the competence of investment advisors and employees who sell investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
No competence requirements are defined in the legislation.
According to Savikko, there are "a few" banking firms like this.
Savikko says that, since 2000, 13,000–14,000 people have completed APV1 qualifications, while roughly 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisors.
According to Statistics Finland, the average monthly earnings of financial and investment advisors are several thousands of euros, including fees, fringe benefits and profit-based bonuses.
The average monthly salary of regular employees is roughly EUR 5,300.
The top ten per cent receiving the highest salary earns roughly EUR 8,100,
Investment advice in accordance with the Act on Investment Services can only be offered by a licensed company.
An inspection by the Financial Supervisory Authority revealed individual cases where the professional skills and competence of investment advisors were not at a sufficient level on the basis of their actions.
The Financial Supervisory Authority will be authorised to decide what types of skills employees need.
Hovi says that, according to the Government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Supervisory Authority will be authorised to decide on the competence and experience required.
In the future, companies must see to necessary training and, if required, monitoring and continuing training.
According to Hovi, another addition is the requirement to work for a specific period with a more experienced employee, if a person's competence or experience is not at a sufficient level.
According to Hovi, these changes will make the regulations stricter and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter from the beginning of 2018.

The Unknown Soldier sells toilet brushes – "There's a unifying story"
Two days ago, Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product range,
Here, the Unknown Soldier refers to the film which premiers in the autumn and its marketing.
What does Aino Määttä, vice president at Sinituote, have to say?
Our aim was to support Finnish production and a cult film", Määttä says.
According to Määttä, the products will be on special display in shops, giving visibility to the film.
Isn't there something funny about this? After all, one would think that there is something in common between Sini's products and the stories linked with them.
Other sponsors of the Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.

West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
The rally erupted in cheers.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
At the end of the week, thunderstorms will also reach southern Finland.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, strokes of lightning ignited several fires.
Thundershowers have finally found their way to Finland.
In Pöytyä, lightning struck the distribution board of a terraced house, igniting a small fire.
The distribution board was located in a sauna at the end of the terraced house.
Rescue personnel dismantled parts of the roof and wall in order to locate any fire pockets and extinguished the fire quickly.
In Loimaa, lightning set a shed on fire in Harjulantie a little before midnight.
The shed of roughly 50 square metres burned to the ground.
In Rääkkylä near Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house.
Information about the fault was obtained on Thursday morning between 8 and 9 am, after which scheduled traffic was replaced by buses.
The problems was only repaired a little before 5 pm,
after which railway traffic has continued normally, also in the track section damaged by lightning.
Thunderstorms have wreaked havoc in different parts of Finland.
However, there have been fairly few lightning flashes this summer.
The intensity of the thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday was mainly moderate but, due to the poor lightning situation this summer, many regarded them as heavy storms.
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.
Production company disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland
"I was afraid that Finnish audiences may be too conservative, and it seems that I was right."

Tom of Finland was directed by Dome Karukoski.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
Hurry up: Coach of Finnish World Championships athletes stuck in Helsinki
Suren Ghazaryan, coach of long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä, is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without hearing the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualification tomorrow and Mäkelä in the triple jump qualification on Saturday.
Their coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not obtained a visa for the UK.
Ghazaryan has visited the British Embassy to take care of the matter, but to no avail.
The coach has an invitation sent by the organisers of the World Championships, but it has not been enough to get a visa.
"He has always obtained a visa with success, but this time there's a problem.
He's doing everything he can to make it to London."
Ghazaryan has worked at the Finnish Athletics Federation for years.
The IAAF World Championships in London will start this Friday, ending after a little more than a week on Sunday 13 August.
At the previous IAAF World Championships in 2015, Finland won one bronze medal
by Tero Pitkämäki in javelin.
For other Finnish athletes, reaching the finals or making a personal best would be a good result.
Growing young talents and supporting them financially is more important that maintaining a small elite group of top athletes.
Hopefully, the World Championships in London remain in history because of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terrorism or cowardly attacks.

Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
It's a brilliant idea.
At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
Toni Tauru will face a tough opponent in Macao, as Leandro Issa from Brazil fought in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) last year.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
That was my requirement," she says.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.

In summer 1996, a booth was set up in the Lahti market square selling Thai food.
Those living in Lahti didn't have the courage to have a taste, they simply walked by.
Because people didn't have the courage to go and eat, Panja offered free bites.
I used to go more often, eventually every day.
In summer 1997, Panja opened a Thai restaurant in the Lahti market hall.
When you're hungry and not many seats are available, you can't leave an empty seat between yourself and a stranger.
Slowly, we got to know each other better and became friends.
A new spot became available at the end of the market hall,
with more space.
Now we can be grumpy at our own tables. Only during the busiest hours do we need to timidly ask strangers whether the seat next to them is available.
Panja knows her customers.
In addition to our sense of taste, she has opened up our hearts and minds.
I admire Panja.
Panja served us customers strawberry cake for dessert.
Discovered underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists ready to strike in Europe
Of the listed persons, 130 come from Iraq, but there are also six Europeans
Others are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat reported the discovery of the list two weeks ago.
Now, the location where the list was found and the information it contains have been specified.
US intelligence authorities examined the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
Next to his photo, suicide bomber is written as his specialty.
Roughly 6,000 fighters, whose destiny is unknown, have left Europe to join Isis.
Even a bucket can save the life of a drowning person.
According to Ville Estlander, on-call fire and rescue officer from the Helsinki rescue department, the situation was quickly over.
Estlander says that the man was close to 50 years of age.
This was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police department.
Two cars collided in Eura – nine people in the two cars, three seriously injured
The on-call fire and rescue officer says that there were a total of nine people in the two cars, the rest of whom suffered more minor injuries.
There were both men and women among the injured.
The accident took place at an intersection of three roads at 4 pm.
According to the rescue department, there is an 80 km/h speed limit in the area.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Okay.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year agreement with PSG
Earlier on Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the release fee of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona playing in the Spanish Primera División.
The incredible transfer fee of EUR 222 million is the highest fee ever paid in the history of football.
The earlier record was held by Manchester United which paid EUR 105 million for French Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned company from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Bestselling author Raija Oranen, famous for Finnish TV series Ruusun aika and Puhtaat valkeat lakanat, recently celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Oranen.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the travel industry, have already been together for more than 40 years.
"I finally decided that the Raikas family works in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th birthday interview on an aeroplane.
I was the daughter of a dressmaker. My mother also had her own shop, and I used to work as a model for her", Oranen remembers.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.

Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won another gold medal in World Championships: "Without the accident, I wouldn't be the World Champion"
Early on Wednesday morning, Matti Suur-Hamari won the gold medal in the banked slalom event in the World Championships held in Big White, Canada.
"These World Championships have been pretty amazing!
According to Suur-Hamari, the number of challengers is constantly increasing.
Suur-Hamari lost one of his legs in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
You play the hand you're dealt", Suur-Hamari stresses.
I wouldn't be a three-time World Champion without the accident."
They were only distant dreams that nearly died as time moved on.
After the accident, I somehow found myself racing at the X-Games.
I was 23 and I thought that this will be a long life if I stay here feeling bitter and feeling sorry for myself.
I'd say that I've succeeded quite well."
The rider was elated when wheelchair racer Leo-Pekka Tähti was selected the Athlete of the Year in Finland.
The four-time Olympic gold medallist received the award at the Sports Gala held in May.
According to Suur-Hamari, this recognition is an important signal for parasports.
This will undoubtedly turn eyes towards parasports."
When will be the time to launch the campaign for selecting two-time World Champion Matti Suur-Hamari the Athlete of the Year?
I'm doing my best to succeed."
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey identified the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread at a refugee camp in Jordan.
The Trump administration is not expected to bring about a change to the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, a global public relations and communications firm, conducted an international survey to identify the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees.
This year's A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey identified the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February and March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18–24 responded to the survey. Half of these were women and half were men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
Military actions alone cannot resolve the conflict
The majority of all respondents considered that ending the war is more important Bashar al-Assad renouncing power.
Nearly half of all respondents felt that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Nearly as many respondents mentioned military actions and an educational reform as primary means.
A little more than ten per cent thought that the most important factor would be to create better paying jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 per cent of all respondents said that the conflict will not change during Trump's tenure.
Whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict split the respondents into two groups.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding in Kauniainen to keep the internet in perfect order – his database is used by Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB, a company based in Espoo, is developing "the world's fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, established by coder and entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, is free of charge for its users, and it can be developed by any skilled programmer through the Internet.
For example, Google and Wikipedia use the Finnish database, but they may not be any paying customers.
If you use, for example, LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, you are using the database of MariaDB or MySQL.
Widenius, together with David Axmark from Sweden, is the developer of MySQL, the world's most popular open source database.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL at a price of one billion dollars and, a year later, software giant Oracle acquired Sun at 7.4 billion dollars.
When the Oracle deal landed, the majority of MySQL developers announced their intention to leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle which didn't give a definite promise of the future of MySQL", Widenius says.
At this stage, he had already established a company to develop MariaDB.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop a new branch from it.
Even though many have heard of Widenius and the billion dollar MySQL deal, not many in Finland know anything about MariaDB.
A switch from MySQL to MariaDB is quick and easy, as the two are different versions of each other.
For example, Telefónica, a Spanish telecom operator, and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The database market is still dominated by giants, such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP, with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL means a modest secondary business opportunity compared with its traditional closed database.
Even though the largest database companies have lost their market shares according to research company Gartner, players such as MariaDB are small and insignificant firms, albeit quickly growing ones, measured by net sales.
In the database market of roughly 50 million dollars, open source databases cannot even reach the threshold of one billion.
However, the significance of open source software cannot be measured in money alone, as the majority of users do not pay anything for its use.
As licence fees go higher year after year, customers will eventually switch to an open source database.
Besides, many companies are facing major system changes when they transfer their functions to cloud services.
At the same time, many want to change their database software.
This was the largest growth loan ever given by the EIB in the Nordic countries.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, among others.
In Europe, the public sector is paying billions of euros a year for databases.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I believe that it is a better way of coding.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give four to five speeches on open source in different parts of the world.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of murdering his spouse in Enontekiö, suspect found in open country – case forwarded to the prosecutor

Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
My son was my best friend."
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She has shown no remorse."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
The case has divided legal opinion.
NATO Secretary General: Worst relations with Russia since the Cold War
"I think it is correct to say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has been any time since the end of the Cold War", Stoltenberg told CNN.
"At the end of the Cold War, we hoped to develop a close partnership with Russia.
But particularly after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued Russian destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, the relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated considerably."
"As long as we are strong, as long as we are predictable, we can also engage in political dialogue with Russia to try to avoid escalation and avoid a new Cold War."
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan officials is higher than the number of actual voters by at least one million.
Tibisay Lucenan, chair of the national election committee told reporters that this is an unprecedented opinion from a company which has no role in the election results.
The opposition has already strongly criticised the elections and organised protests.

A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
They relied on his routine.
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
Trusting one's instincts.
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project starts with a huge setback – "It's tough"
Hannu Manninen turned 39 in April, but did not celebrate long, as the professional pilot started to prepare for the Olympic season.
However, the training period had a catastrophic start when Manninen caught the flu.
"First I had the flu and finally an ear infection, for which I had to take antibiotics.
I was able to complete some ten per cent of the planned training sessions.
I don't remember the last time I was that sick.
Test results came down
The gold medallist in 2007 World Championships was only allowed to train during the second week of June. This was reflected in the results of the treadmill test conducted by KIHU – the Research Institute for Olympic Sports – on 12 June.
After initial difficulties, Manninen says that he has stayed healthy.
Last season, Manninen only raced in four World Cup competitions before the World Championships in Lahti.
Manninen reached his best position in the opening competition when he climbed up to 18th place after an excellent skiing performance.
Manninen and Petter Kukkonen, head coach of the national team, have prepared a training and racing plan up to February.
The season opener is followed by a weekend of three World Cup starts in Ruka.
In December, the plan is to take part in at least one World Cup weekend, possibly in Ramsau.
Then, the plan is to race in Seefeld at the end of January.
The Olympics in PyeongChang would be the sixth Winter Games for Manninen.
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Man threatened to blow up an Islamic bookshop and "kill all the Muslims" in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic", the sentenced man told the police.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for his threats to blow up an Islamic bookshop and "kill all the Muslims" in London.
The Independent reported that David Moffatt was sentenced, for example, for aggravated intentional harassment.
as the man had threatened to "blow up the bookshop and kill all the Muslims."
The threat did not have anything to do with the events in the bookshop.
"The authorities noticed that Moffatt was wearing similar clothes to the person suspected of the events in the bookshop", stated the police press officer.
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic", Moffatt told the police during interrogations.
According to a Scotland Yard press officer, hate crimes are often left unreported.
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
British organisation sceptical about beloved Finnish innovation: "no evidence" of health benefits of maternity package
A British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish maternity packages.
BBC and Guardian, among others, report that Lullaby Trust, a charitable organisation aiming to prevent unexpected deaths in infancy, forbids the use of its brochures in maternity packages handed over in the UK.
Distributing maternity packages to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduced the risk of sudden infant death,
Lullaby Trust acts as an expert for health authorities in the UK in terms of a safe night's sleep for children.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to Lullaby Trust, this low rate results from many reasons, such as the low number of teen rapes.
However, this cannot be said for certain", says Francine Bates, Chief Executive of Lullaby Trust.
The maternity package is a Finnish innovation, and it has been distributed to all Finnish mothers free of charge for 80 years.
This year's package contains 53 different products.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes distributed in Scotland fulfil all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard set for cardboard boxes acting as beds.
According to Lullaby Trust, the package may be the best option for a place to sleep if no bassinet or crib is available.
Fleet-footed tortoise escaped again from a Japanese zoo
Staff at a Japanese zoo looking for an escaped tortoise.
The tortoise escaped from the Shibukawa zoo located in Okayama in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness accounts of the tortoise.
Yamane discovered it walking on a road some 150 m from the zoo.
"I saw it on my way to the zoo.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
Do you care?
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
The woman living in Gothenburg had gotten out of the shower at her home when she noticed a mobile phone suspended from a cord outside her window.
When she returned to check the situation, the mobile phone was first pulled up but quickly lowered down again.
During interrogations, the man admitted to shooting the video, but denied being guilty of any crime.
According to TT, the man will be indicted.
Teachers demand more money during autumn negotiations
Luukkainen is also the president of the Negotiation Organisation for Public Sector Professionals (JUKO).
According to OAJ, learning results are decreasing and differences between individuals and regions are increasing.
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
Freedom in Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in Rwanda in central Africa on Friday with little doubt over the winner.
Paul Kagame is officially aiming for his third term but, in practice, he has had his say in leading the country since 1994.
That was when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) stopped the genocide organised by Hutu extremists.
Kagame has been criticised, for example, for crushing the opposition and limiting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics.
During his presidency, social reforms have been made and international investments have flown into the country.
What is more, Kagame has played an important part in unifying the country divided by the genocide.
The success of Rwanda has made many Africans doubt whether a liberal multi-party democracy is the right way for African states.

Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
Maybe the two are connected?"
With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
Worst relations with Russia since the Cold War
"I think it is correct to say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is more difficult than it has been any time since the end of the Cold War", Stoltenberg told CNN.
"At the end of the Cold War, we hoped to develop a close partnership with Russia.
But especially after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued Russian destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, the relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated considerably."
"As long as we are strong, as long as we are predictable, we can also engage in political dialogue with Russia to try to avoid escalation and avoid a new Cold War."
Wladimir Klitschko retires – no rematch against Anthony Joshua
Long-time heavyweight champion in professional boxing Wladimir Klitschko retires.
In April this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost the fierce fight via technical knockout in the 11th round.
However, Klitschko was unable to find motivation for the fight.
"As an amateur and a professional boxer, I have achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I would have never imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
Therefore this is definitively the right decision", Bönte said.
Since 2009, Klitschko has been with American actress Hayden Panettiere.
Pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the weather conditions during this summer season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the weather conditions.
Unstable conditions are also expected for the World Championships in London.
This summer, weather conditions have been against pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen.
"I wouldn't like to blame the track, but it's inconceivable that I couldn't even get my shorter poles working properly", Nikkanen said after her competition in Innsbruck.
There's no point in consuming energy in bad conditions."
The conditions are not the same for everyone in London.
This year, I probably should have done the same.
He says that there is nothing to distribute.
Yle interviewed Virtanen, who retired in 2015, in Ykkösaamu on Wednesday.
The preparation of next year's state budget is about to begin.
Virtanen regards the recent proposals of politicians for increasing the standard pension, decreasing car taxes and supporting electric bikes as election rhetoric.
They mainly indicate that elections are approaching. After all, as ten per cent of the state budget is funded by borrowing more money, there is nothing to distribute, now or in many years to come.
Virtanen has a long history in preparing state budgets: he started working in the Ministry of Finance in 1978 as a budget secretary, and worked since as a deputy manager of the budget department and as a budget manager.
Before his retirement, he worked as the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.

The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
Spouse of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margrethe.

"It's no secret that the Prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy", Lene Belleby, press secretary of the Danish Royal Court commented in the newspaper.
The Prince's decision not to be buried next to the Queen is a natural consequence of him feeling that he is not treated as an equal to his spouse.
According to the Royal Court, the Queen has for long been aware of her spouse's wish regarding his place of burial and understands his decision.

Show directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with relationships by means of comedy – Itsensäpaljastelija will be performed at Mikä? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first theatre production as a director to the Mikä? Theatre.
Itsensäpaljastelija (Exhibitionist) is a musical theatre show about relationships gone bad and insufficiency.
Director Lotta Jäppinen says that it will still make audiences feel good.
"The themes are dealt with by means of comedy.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre show has been produced with a small budget, but with a big young heart.
Jäppinen has both directed the show and adapted it for the stage.
She is also in charge of lighting.
The show consists of texts written by the working group, and there is no plot.
The director believes that, even though the show gets its inspiration from young people's thoughts, it speaks to people of all ages.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen thinks that Itsensäpaljastelija draws a topical picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
at least that it is important to listen to yourself.
There is no need to stay in a relationship that does not work.
The show is performed by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
Music has been arranged by Jäppinen and Rokka.
Love for the theatre ignited in Kouvola

Finnish Olympic winner took one year to recover from a terrible motocross accident – cervical spine fractured
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela kept going.
In 2014, he was in a motocross accident,
There was also bad luck involved.
"Riding a motocross bike may seem wild.
His active life came to a full stop.
He had recently returned from a long stint as the head coach of the national freestyle team of Japan.
Lahtela started in this position immediately after his career ended in 2006.
I didn't really do anything", says Lahtela.
"Surprisingly, having to stop was a positive experience.
The forced break inspired Lahtela to start as the head coach of Team Finland.
If he had not had to stop, he might have burnt out.
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realised that I needed so much rest."
Lahtela started as the head coach of the national freestyle team of Finland a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace high-speed sports.
"I replaced motocross with disc golf!
At worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing."
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.

On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Police suspects: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia by group led by Isis leader
A leader of the terrorist organisation Isis led a group of Australian men who are suspected of planning to take a bomb on board an Etihad Airways plane.
According to the suspects, their intention was to plant the bomb on the plane on 15 July, but their attempt failed before the security checkpoint.
Michael Phelan, a deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, says that this was one of the most professional plans ever witnessed in Australia.
Due to the plans of suspected terrorists, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.

Shefki Kuqi sacked by Inter – "No trust among directors"
Italian Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach, for example, in Sunderland in the UK.
Piccareta, 51, who joined Inter's coaching staff in January, completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, chairman of the Board of Directors of FC Inter, feels sorry about the situation.
However, Shefki Kuqi didn't enjoy the trust of the club's directors, and there was no other choice", Håkans commented in the club's press release.
Piccareta's agreement extends until the end of the season.
He will take charge, together with the other coaching staff, at tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to sources of Ilta-Sanomat, tensions have been high within the team throughout Thursday.
Linda Lampenius published a photo from the 1980s – Can you recognise the serious violin student?
Lampenius has previously posted photos from her past and also talked about difficult subjects.
One of the photos shows her 20 years ago, in the other she poses now, as a mother of two.
In the text, Lampenius thinks about how she has grown as a person and makes a reference to eating disorders she suffered from when she was younger.
"Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and the way I look", Lampenius wrote.
Lampenius has talked openly about her earlier eating disorders.
At the age of 14, she has hospitalised for anorexia and orthorexia.
She slowly started to feel better.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by her new love.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.

Reuters: A grand jury has already issued indictments related to Trump Jr.'s meeting in Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has issued indictments with regard to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian legal counsel.
The grand jury, summoned by special counsel Robert Mueller, has already issued indictments relating to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian legal counsel famous for her Kremlin connections.
This was reported by Reuters which also confirms the information revealed by Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday about summoning a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has issued indictments relating to the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin connections, organised during the US presidential elections in June 2016.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, issue indictments and force people to testify under oath.
A grand jury examines evidence investigated by a prosecutor and decides whether an indictment should be issued.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.

White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."

Russian man extradited from Finland was sentenced to four years of imprisonment in the USA
On Thursday, the District Court of Minneapolis in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senakh to nearly four years of imprisonment for his involvement in a global computer fraud.
Senakh was apprehended in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a claim issued by the USA.
According to Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senakh was on holiday in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities apprehended him when he was returning home.
In March, he was found guilty of a computer fraud to generate millions of dollars in profits.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senakh will be expelled once he has served his sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed Finland harshly after the apprehension and stated that Senakh must not be extradited to the United States.
In its statement, it criticised Finland and the USA for apprehending the man in Finland without notifying Russia of the situation beforehand.
According to the prosecutor's office, Senakh had used a computer virus called Ebury to infect tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was then used to phish usernames and passwords.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, this case indicates that the USA is also able to chase cybercriminals operating in other countries.

NYT: Calls praised by Trump were phony – White House press secretary: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The calls with the President of Mexico and the leader of the Boy Scouts praised by Trump turned out to be fabrications.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, confirmed that neither one of the calls took place.
According to Sanders, many leaders of the Boy Scouts talked with Trump in person, and Trump had a conversation with Enrique Peña Nieto, the President of Mexico, at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
