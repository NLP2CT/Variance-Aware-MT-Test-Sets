Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the establishment of administrative liability for violating the deadline and procedures for payment of goods (works, services) as part of procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is meant to solve the very serious issue of customers failing to fulfill their commitments as part of state and municipal procurements.
At that time, the Russian president tasked the Office of Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation with taking the issue under special control.
The problem was systemic throughout the entire country.
Since 2015, 9,700 petitions, in the interests of protecting the rights of business owners to receive payment for public contracts, were filed by the Office of the Prosecutor General: according to the results of their investigations, 4,500 officials were subject to disciplinary measures, and 533 were held administratively liable; 75 cases were submitted to the investigative authorities for procedural review, and criminal proceedings were initiated in 46 of them.
In sum, more than 66 billion rubles worth of debt owed to business owners was repaid.
Here is a typical case.
The person invested all of their working capital, fully satisfied their commitments, but didn’t receive the allotted money when it was due.
The result is an escalating financial snowball comprised of payroll, tax, and loan liabilities, which would have led to bankruptcy if the business owner hadn’t approached the prosecutor’s office for assistance.
Now, in a number of regions, they have managed to mitigate the problem to the greatest extent possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt related to state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to approximately 27.4 billion rubles.
The realization of Federal Law No. 189-FZ “On amending the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in terms of establishing administrative liability for officials of a customer for violating the deadline and procedures for payment of goods (works, services) as part of procurement for state and municipal needs”, which was signed by the Russian president last week, will qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public sector customers.

One of the perpetrators has been apprehended, but the second managed to escape.
The Russian Federal Tourism Agency supports the law eliminating the free baggage allowance for non-refundable airline tickets
The head of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency, Oleg Safonov, said in an interview with RBK television channel that he is “in favor” of adopting a law eliminating the free baggage allowance for non-refundable airline tickets.
“We need to establish conditions whereby a person who doesn’t have baggage can purchase a cheaper ticket than a person who has baggage”, he emphasized (quoted by TASS).
“It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to operate here; the sewage treatment plants, the majority of them are worn-out”, RIA Novosti quotes the president as saying.
He also added that the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation should conduct an inquiry to identify environmentally destructive activities.
According to him, there are problems connected to illegal dumping and a range of environmental violations by recreation operators in the area around the lake.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office reported a reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed increasing the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
There will be a new church in Yurga
In the village of Sosva, members of the Rakhtynya community of indigenous peoples of the North, along with residents of Berezovsky District, will take part in the construction of an orthodox church in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
The church was named in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, since the Orthodox Church venerates him as the patron of travellers, including fishermen.
Local residents are waiting for the day the church opens its doors, and children are even writing school compositions about it as a local attraction.
Why are laws obeyed in Singapore?

In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport: he was carrying 400 g of cocaine on him.
The Australian prime minister (threatening sanctions), international human rights advocates, and even the Pope came to his defense.

For example, chewing gum is only sold in pharmacies, and it can only by bought with a doctor’s prescription!
The particularly absurd laws only exist on paper, and over the past twenty years, I haven’t seen anyone be charged for breaking them.
So that citizens don’t become complacent.
Is it justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads: motorists ignored traffic lights, drove however they wanted, and got behind the wheel drunk.

Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.

He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."

The Moscow City Court has changed the sentence for the disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow City Court has changed the sentence for the disabled man, Aton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in a penal colony, to a fine in the amount of 200,000 rubles.
TASS reports about this.
Previously, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to change the prison term to a suspended sentence, explaining its request by the fact that Mamayev’s illness “prevents him from being in prison conditions.”
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment, to be served in a standard regime penal colony, for a robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at an off-site session in the pretrial detention facility.

The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.

Local people struggle to compete.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.

Andrey Malakhov has indicated to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov dropped a hint for his fans on Instagram about who is to blame for his departure from First Channel.
Until now, he hasn’t commented on the rumors, but today he posted an excerpt from an article in the newspaper Vedomosti from August 1.
If we recall the numerous reports about the host not being able to find common ground with the recently arrived producer, who set out to reformat “Let Them Talk”, it becomes clear what he was dropping such strong hints about, KP writes.
It has been reported that television host Andrey Malakhov is currently on leave and hasn’t signed a letter of resignation from First Channel.
The situation surrounding the termination could become clear in the coming days.

EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
The Congress of the IAAF has extended the suspension of the All-Russia Athletic Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF).
166 people voted to extend the suspension, with 21 against, TASS reports.
The ARAF was subjected to an indefinite ban from the IAAF in 2015.
At that time, a report was published by Dick Pound, an independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which spoke about numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more on the latest IAAF Council report, read the Kommersant article: “The IAAF has extended sanctions against the ARAF”.
Khimik was in no way inferior to its opponent, but a moment of inattentiveness at the end of the match led to the bitter goal and a fiasco.
In the 1st half, the Kalugans were more active and had the advantage in terms of possession of the ball.
Unfortunately, Khimik’s offensive game didn’t have enough force and luck to stymie Kaluga’s defense and score the first goal of the away game.
Just 10 minutes before the end of the match, Khimik regained territorial advantage and conducted several risky attacks.
Following a dangerous attack, Khimik moved the ball to corner area, which the home team kicked into the net without opposition.
Yury Dubrovin was the goal scorer.
The Khimik lineup: Sirotin, Manokhin (c), Romaschenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoyevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

The special prosecutor on Russia, Robert Mueller, has convened a grand jury in Washington that will investigate Russia’s influence on the US presidential election in 2016, the Wall Street Journal newspaper and Reuters news agency report.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens that collects evidence of possible criminal offenses and has the right to question witnesses under oath.
The special prosecutor will examine the collected material and will decide if it is sufficient to file charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimonial evidence.
Mueller himself already promised to verify the details of this meeting held in June 2016.
They have already been examined by the FBI.
At the beginning of August, information appeared in some media sources that Trump Jr.’s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was practically dictated by Trump Sr.

Unlike Soviet-era monuments that are being torn down in some countries, monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, are “spreading across the planet”.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany, in the city of Erfurt, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992, thanks to public protests, and was relocated from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin’s 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the given name and surname of the first cosmonaut sound in Latvian, and he looks as though he has reached the age of 70.

"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
Absolutely no one laughs.
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.

A court has fined Navalny for violations at a “campaign subbotnik”
Moscow’s Simonovsky Court has fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the procedure for organizing a rally.
The opposition figure was found guilty of committing an administrative offence specified in part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation, “Repeat violation of the procedure for organizing a rally”.
Earlier, the judge for Moscow’s Simonovsky Court, Khizir Mussakaev, finished hearing the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, head of the main office for the opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, who was held liable under the very same article as Navalny.
This is the amount that Judge Mussakaev assessed for the distribution of leaflets at a “campaign subbotnik” that Navalny’s supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev, petitioned for a termination of the administrative proceedings, due to an absence of concrete evidence of an offense, and pointed to the fact that the police made specific mistakes when preparing the report.
Volkov wasn’t detained at the actual “campaign subbotnik”, but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station to give a statement about the event, which was held with his active participation.
Navalny himself and another colleague of the opposition figure, Nikolai Lyaskin, also received summons.

Deputies are asking the police to restrict traffic on the waterfront in Pskov

New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.

During a videoconference dedicated to fighting the fires in Buryatia and Irkutsk Oblast, the interlocutor turned to Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you; when the next presidential election takes place, we all ask that you run for this position again”.

The Comandante Borsini patrol ship entered Libya’s territorial waters so as to then stop the flow of illegal migrants in cooperation with that country’s navy.
Italian authorities settled on establishing a naval mission to combat illegal migration in July, when statistics for the number of illegals who have sailed to the country from Libya were made public: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government announced that resources for the settlement of migrants have been depleted.

Two Team Ukraine leaders in track and field were suspended from participating in the World Championships
This decision was made by the organization’s executive committee in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the track athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from August 4-13.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
Just a week ago, deputies were planning to directly determine the procedure for the oath-swearing ceremony in the law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as the legally incapacitated, will be exempt from taking the solemn oath, it appears from a revised text of amendments to the proposed law “On Citizenship of the Russian Federation” (Izvestia has a copy at its disposal), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on July 11.
Deputies put this idea into action through amendments to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the reversal of a decision to grant citizenship to those who are later convicted of a range of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for publicly calling for terrorist activity or for publicly justifying them in the media or on the internet (part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for high-jacking an aircraft, train, or waterborne vessel, but only in the event this act is related to terrorism (part 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
The bill was introduced in the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions, Vladimir Vasilyev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhironovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (A Just Russia), and by the speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The following week, the State Duma Committee on State-Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for its second reading; however, it has now been revised once again.
In all likelihood, it could even be the civil registry offices.
A week ago, the draft mentioned that the oath must precede the signing of the decree.
The rule, according to which the legally incapacitated or partially incapacitated, as well as those who are unable to say, read, or independently sign the text of the oath, are exempt from taking the oath, was retained.
Additionally, the Russian president has the right to exempt “other persons” from this procedure.
The updated bill also spells out the specific procedure for granting Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine who are regarded as native speakers of Russian.
They will have to officially renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by presenting the relevant application form for this to the authorized Ukrainian authority.
A notarized copy of the application form will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
A renouncement of “foreign” citizenship, as is the case right now, is not required if it is provided for by international agreement or if it is not possible “due to factors beyond the control of the individual”.
The respective amendment to the law was suggested by a group of deputies, including First Vice-Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov, and Ayrat Farrakhov (all from United Russia).
As such, a whole lot of people are awaiting a decision on their fate in terms of Russian citizenship, the head of the Duma Committee on State-Building and Legislation, Pavel Krasheninnikov (UR), explained the other day.
In addition to this, a clarification appeared in the text stating that the restriction on foreigners holding certain positions will not apply to those who have renounced their “other” citizenship in writing and have surrendered their previous passport to the Russian Ministry of the Interior, but have not ceased being a citizen of another country “due to factors beyond their control”.
It is anticipated that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, and the requisite subordinate regulatory acts must be ready by that time.
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The prize money for the Russian Football Super Cup match between Spartak and Lokomotiv will amount to about 30 million rubles.
The president of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL), Sergey Pryadkin, announced this at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that, by now, there are hardly any tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, July 14 at 9:30 p.m.
As noted by TASS, Spartak is the current Russian champion, while Lokomotiv holds the country’s Cup title.
The other day, a 37-year-old resident of Ufa, who owns a furniture business, contacted the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the workshop, which dealt a serious blow to his business.
According to the press service for the republic’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, the criminal associates entered the grounds of the business, forced open the front door, and carried out the tools.
A criminal case for theft has already been initiated against them, while law enforcement officers were able to return just some of the stolen tools to their rightful owner.
The State Department has commented on Medvedev’s remarks on Russia-US relations
Such a statement was delivered by the State Department’s official spokesperson, Heather Nauert, in response to the remarks of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations of the two states.
“Take a look at the ceasefire in southwest Syria, which has held firm for almost a month already”.
“This is an example of good US-Russian cooperation”, RIA Novosti quotes the diplomat as saying.
That being said, the spokesperson for the foreign policy establishment declined to comment on the Russian prime minister’s statement equating the sanctions to a trade war.
A bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK, was signed by US President Donald Trump this past Wednesday.
Dior has “grown” roses made of amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior – Dior Joaillerie – has added to the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
Five new rings and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons have been added to them.
Two new rings and a pendant made from amethysts, rose quartz, and diamonds, created using glyptic (engraving of gemstones by hand) and pavé setting techniques, were released in the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line to mark the house’s 70th anniversary.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellane, was inspired by the roses that fashion designer Christian Dior grew at his estate in Granville and by the Bagatelle and Pré-Catelan gardens in Paris.
Trump has found the culprits behind deteriorating relations with Russia
They, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House released a statement by the president, in which he pointed out that the law would prevent the US from concluding lucrative deals and would bring Russia, China, and North Korea even closer together.
A Belorussian entrepreneur has backed out of buying Sberbank’s Ukrainian subsidiary
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Viktor Prokopenya, has withdrawn a bid from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to purchase a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBK as an intention “to concentrate on our other planned investments and projects we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopenya, this move will be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of the Sberbank subsidiary acquisition.
Mr. Prokopenya became the prime contender for the buy-out of the division of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU declined a consortium bid by Grigory Guselnikov’s NorvikBank and Said Gutseriev’s Belorussian company in July.
One of these financial organizations, in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank, was Sberbank.
Novak has identified the cause of the blackout in Crimea
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity as a result of a traffic accident in Krasnodar Krai.
Technicians fixed the problems over the course of a few hours.
At first, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could have been a heat wave.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.
Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
The World Congress of Tatars has adopted a resolution to support the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) has adopted a resolution that notes the importance of retaining the post of the president in Tatarstan.
To recap, the treaty between Moscow and Kazan, in force since July 24, 2007, was signed for a period of 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan approached the president of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and retain the name of the position of the head of the region.
Currently, Tatarstan is the only constituent entity of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only post that goes by the name of “president”.
Difficulties have arisen with obtaining international driving permits in Russia
State Traffic Safety Inspectorate departments are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IDP).
To get such permits, one must wait their turn for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to go on holiday abroad using their car or rent one there.
It’s worth mentioning that the situation with international driving permits remains contradictory.
The requirements for international driving permits are written in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian permits are recognized already.
Currently, there is a problem with the forms at almost every department of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate, Kommersant reports, after conducting an investigation in several regions.
It’s possible to register for an appointment on the state services website, but the waitlist on there already extends into the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get the IDP “due to technical reasons”, without going into details; in Samara Oblast, to be honest, there are no forms, and it’s a similar situation in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already been faced with this issue; messages like this are popping up with increasing frequency on social media:
That’s right, because all of the departments of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate have run out of forms.
Do you think it will work?
The Russian Ministry of the Interior explained that the requirements for the international driving permit forms have changed, and that the delivery of new forms to departments of the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate is currently underway.
This might be related to the shortage, however, it’s unclear what changes they are talking about, since nothing was announced previously.
Over the past few years, all contracts were signed with JSC Goznak: between 2014-2015, almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced; in 2016, 15,000 forms were purchased; in 2017 – 90,000; but, the most recent contract was signed on July 18 with OOO First Print Yard to produce 70,000 forms.
Recently, it came to light that professional drivers will have to pass a test to verify their skills.
The Ministry of Transport came up with this proposal.
The new version of the international driver’s permit (IDP) has been in use since May 31, 2011.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview on the Obozrevatel website.
Not a single self-respecting international company would put even a tiny bolt or nut in there, because they would risk losing their business in the EU, USA, Japan – the countries that joined in sanctions against Russia in relation to Crimea.
“Therefore, I consider the best instrument in this situation to be sanctions against companies who turned out to be shortsighted enough to join this project”, the official noted.
On July 31, construction workers finished installing the vehicle arch of the Crimea Bridge.
On the Kerch shore, preassembly of the road transport arch of the Crimea Bridge has been completed: its arch is capped at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
“At the same time, bridge builders prepared to install the fairway supports for the railway arch”, the project’s information center reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that construction on the project was ahead of schedule.
The Crimea Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Krai.
An official who didn’t go to work for 10 years was fired in Spain
What kind of angelic patience (or utter indifference to public service) did the boss of the Spanish official, Carlos Recio, have to possess?
But not by his direct supervisor.
Ordinary people, it seems, have long become accustomed to all the antics of the “servants of the people”.
But, nevertheless, officials always manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live quite well.
This time the “sensation” hails from Spain.
That being said, he still received his salary regularly.
And then, the “wonderful times” of Mr. Recio came to an end.
It also came to light that the absentee dedicated all his free time to drawing comics at home.
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC), under instructions from Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch.
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals, which are concerned both with issues of ensuring judicial independence and uncovering miscarriages of justice, as well as with funding for courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders involves limiting the powers of court chairpersons to increase the independence of the other judges.
If a judicial candidate has successfully completed the selection process and has received the support of the community of judges, then the court chairperson, in the opinion of the HRC, ought to submit their nomination without having the right to refuse, as the law currently allows.
In addition to this, the presidential council considers it essential to move to “the election of court chairpersons by judges themselves” and “confer their powers for a relatively short term with mandatory rotation”.
In order to shield judges from pressure by regional administrations, the HRC suggests organizing appeal and cassations courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Currently, their structure is tied to the administrative territorial division of the Russian Federation.
The HRC says “it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate appellate and cassation courts that are not on the same level as the regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but rather in judicial districts”.
The HRC proposes strengthening justices of the peace with people’s assessors, so as to examine certain “categories of civil and administrative cases” with their participation.
“These are only our proposals”, a member of the HRC and a retired judge for the Constitutional Court, Tamara Morshchakova, explained to Kommersant.
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
The Russian government has approved the establishment of a commission on issues of state cultural policy.
The deputy chair of the Russian Government has been appointed as head of the commission.
In 2016, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved an implementation plan for the strategy of the state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan is comprised of 193 events and provides for measures aimed at expanding the influence of Russian culture in other countries, maintaining a common cultural space and cultural legacy, and it will also encourage the creation of conditions for cultural development in the country.
Growth of consumer prices in countries belonging to the G20 fell to the lowest level in the past eight years, the Wall Street Journal reports with reference to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decline in Russia’s consumer price index by 0.1%.
As such, the agency recorded the first week-long deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance’s calculations, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economic Development, however, is of the opinion that the target value has already been achieved: according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal deforestation during a meeting concerning the environmental development of Baikal’s natural territory.
It permits forest clearing during the course of fire suppression efforts and the government is planning to pass it as early as the fall.
Donskoi pointed out that this bill calls for oversight from EMERCON and watchdog agencies.
Regular telephone communication has been established at the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
Strana.ua reported this on August 4, citing combatants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication’s information, unit commanders know full well the names of their colleagues from the opposing side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was outraged by the blocking of statements by the UN Security Council concerning attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported this.
The ministry recalled how, on August 2, the grounds of the Russian Embassy in Damascus were subjected to mortar fire, for the third time in a month, at the hands of the Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (the former al-Nusra Front, banned in Russia) and the Faylaq al-Rahman terrorist groups.
Vladimir Putin has come out in favor of limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of businesses
“Unscheduled inspections are conducted, as a rule, without appropriate approval from the prosecutor’s office – only 2-3% are approved with the prosecutor’s office – and all the rest are carried out independently”, TASS quotes the president as saying.
“This, I hope, will have a clearly positive impact on the handling of cases related to business activities or related to violations of the law in the field of business”, the head of state said.
As Kommersant reported, as a result of the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of businesses is growing.
More on business inspections in the Kommersant article: “They’re dropping in on small business from the other side”.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
The Tyumen prosecutor’s office is fighting against an HIV dissident
According to the investigation, the child died because her mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
The case against the female resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (infliction of death by negligence) in April, following the death of her 3-year-old daughter from a stage 4B HIV infection.
“The woman didn’t get treatment for herself and refused treatment for her daughter, believing that HIV doesn’t exist”, the prosecutor’s office for Tyumen Oblast explained.
A request for this was filed by the father of the dead girl, explaining that he had “forgiven his wife, holds no claims against her, and that she has made amends and has apologized”.
The prosecutor’s office did not agree with the court’s decision and filed an appeal demanding a reversal of the decision to dismiss the case and that it be sent for a retrial.
The young girl died and making amends for the harm caused by the crime is impossible.
The HIV-positive mother, against the advice of doctors, refused an examination of the little girl and treatment of this dangerous infection for her”, the press service of the prosecutor’s office reported.
In the opinion of the regulatory agency, she should be punished; otherwise, other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
A gruesome photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, happened on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany train station in Khmelnytskyi.
One of the friends came up with the idea of taking a dramatic selfie on the roof of the wagon, the police communications desk in Khmelnytskyi Oblast reported to FAKTY.
The injured individual was moved to a safe place before the arrival of doctors and was then hospitalized in the burn unit of the Khmelnytskyi Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with 1st and 2nd degree burns to his torso.
Right now, doctors assess his condition as stable.
Law enforcement officials remind us that extreme selfies, taken on the roofs of tall buildings, on bridges, and on top of moving vehicles, have gained increasing popularity as of late.
According to witnesses, several men who were on the bridge started shouting threats.
Another one was given medical assistance, after which he was let go.
The third wounded individual is a minor and there are no details about his condition.
On July 1, at least 17 people were wounded during a shooting in a nightclub in the city of Little Rock in the state of Arkansas.
The rock band Louna will debut a new album in Barnaul
A concert by the rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The group is preparing a conceptual show, which will become the most spectacular in the band’s concert history.
Its title stems from A. Huxley’s famous dystopian novel, “Brave New World”.
In the fall of 2015, the band Louna performed the “Songs about the World” program with a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall.
The concert will be held at Barnaul’s “Pharaoh” club on October 17 at 7 p.m.
Louna is one of the most sought-after groups in the Russian rock scene.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group has won several times in various categories of the “Chart Dozen” hit parade.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'
Crimea is incorporating the New World sparkling wine factory
It appears from an order by the Minister of Property and Land Relations for Crimea, Anna Anyukhina, that a decision has been made to incorporate the Republic of Crimea’s state unitary enterprise, New World sparkling wine factory, as JSC New World sparkling wine factory.
Crimea’s Ministry of Agriculture has stated that, if funds to modernize the enterprise are not found over the next three years, then there will be a risk of a factory shutdown.
1.2 billion rubles are required to modernize the enterprise. Given the nature of its legal and organizational form, it is obliged to hand over 50% of its profits to the state budget.
That which is left is insufficient to implement the modernization program.
“Getting the money from the owner is problematic, suggesting borrowing funds from large credit institutions is difficult”, said the deputy head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea, Sergei Petelin, in April of this year.
Crimea’s parliament has included the enterprise in the privatization forecast plan for 2017.
In 2017, New World planned to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was established in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn, as a factory to produce sparkling wine at the New World estate acquired by him.
The factory is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders knocked over more than 40 headstones
Officers of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior for Nizhny Novgorod Oblast have established the identities of the citizens who destroyed 46 headstones at the cemetery in the town of Lyskovo.
The miscreants turned out to be students in the third grade.
In total, 24 people contacted the police in connection with this.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation: “Destruction, damage, or desecration of burial sites”.
Preventative measures have been carried out with both the children and their parents.
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the auspices the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and State Duma and assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told Kommersant what objectives Moscow is pursuing in this region and whom they are placing their bets on.
There is almost nothing known about the contact group that you head on Libya.
But, in this case, there is a veil of secrecy.
Its activities are overseen by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (a Duma deputy from Chechnya – Kommersant).
The latter was authorized to work on the Libya issue by State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for establishing the group was the detainment of the Russian tanker, Mekhanik Chebotarev, in Libya (in September 2015; 11 people were on board – Kommersant).
Our efforts weren’t restricted to the release of the sailors from the Mekhanik Chebotarev.
Thanks to the active involvement of Ahmed Maiteeq (the deputy prime minister of Libya – Kommersant), we managed to quickly negotiate the release of the Russian sailors.
Among them are people who have experience working in the security agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
And, if yes, whose side are they on?
There are no Russian military experts in Libya.
All the talk and reports about this are inconsistent with reality.
But there are ex-military members in your contact group…
Or, those cities that, up to a certain point, are closed to us, like Misurata (where rebel forces, who played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and became noticeably more active in following years, are based – Kommersant).
We travelled to Misurata in January of this year.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there for ourselves: to analyze the actual military capacity, who is responsible for what, why such rumors are floating about, and what the real role of the Islamists is there.
In Misurata, we met with all of the representatives of the units that were engaged in destroying IS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from militants of the Islamic State, which is banned in Russia – Kommersant).
We wanted to take a look at them, to get to know these people, to verify the intelligence that it was actually these people who played a decisive role in destroying IS in Libya and not Halif Haftar, who has taken credit for these achievements.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Was it not Haftar who defeated the Islamic State in Libya?
Haftar was staging an operation on a different front, in Benghazi.
What do you think: will it be possible to implement the agreements on a ceasefire and holding elections that Halif Haftar and Fayez al-Sarraj reached in July in Paris?
In the recent past, both the leaders spoke very negatively about one another.
As far as Russia’s position is concerned…
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe this.
We were confronted with this situation when we were in Misurata, and Haftar, on that very same day, came aboard the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
You have associated with Haftar.
Does the fact that he twice studied in the USSR make mutual understanding with Russian partners easier on a personal and emotional level?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
And they are drawn to Russia; they feel nostalgic about it to a certain extent.
Are your Libyan partners interested in shipments of Russian arms?
We would like everyone to be on a more or less equal footing.
As far as the arms embargo is concerned, the Libyan side is constantly calling on Russia to somehow facilitate its removal.
Right now the constitution-drafting process is actively moving ahead in Libya.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners with this situation, by using its connections with the Libyans?
That’s a very timely question.
The Italians need Russia’s support, because Moscow is engaged in simultaneous dialogue with Haftar, and with al-Sarraj, and with Misurata, and with the south of the country.
But it isn’t easy.
Some clans and groups have an interest in keeping these flows going.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Fayez al-Sarraj, is considered to be an Islamist and a proponent of the introduction of sharia law in the country.
How radical are the views that he holds?
Won’t this become an obstacle to building a relationship with Russia or the West?
I will tell you my personal opinion of him.
The national oil corporation is there, the national bank, and other government institutions.
Of course, some countries had an interest in not having us involved there.
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanallah, with whom the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, signed the deal, is himself directly from Tripoli.
Two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
There are plans to resign contracts that were concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
And do the Libyans have anything to pay with?
Well, they have oil.
But which states are the fighters coming from then?
I wouldn’t want to go into these details.
There are hardly any Libyans among them: they make up no more than 5%.
The rest of them are outsiders.
There are such plans.
It’s hard to say right now.
The useful present will be awarded to Sasha by the Minister of Culture for Moscow Oblast, Oksana Kosareva, and by the museum’s director, Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the exercise equipment was raised during the “Don’t stop doing good deeds” charity marathon, which took place at Melikhovo on July 15 on Chekhov Memorial Day.
In the days leading up to the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino in Chekhov District, which said: “My eyes can’t see anything, so I asked my mama to write this letter”.
“I would really like to receive the gift of a treadmill, so my legs can become strong, and so that I can learn how to walk a little bit”.
And now Sasha’s dream has come true!
After the presentation, a “Post Scriptum Concert” will be held at the museum-reserve, where the famous pianist and honored artist of Russia, Alexander Gindin, will play a medley of popular classical works.
The Ascension of David Monastery Choir, bell-ringers from Ilya Drozdikhin’s school, students from the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory and the Gnessin Academy of Music, and actors from the Melikhovo Theater’s Chekhov Studio performed during the charity marathon at Melikhovo.
The Melikhovo museum-reserve came forward with the initiative to make July 15 Chekhov Memorial Day: a collective day of charity for all the museums in the Moscow area.
In the words of the suspect, he was enraged by the noise, the department of police communication for Zhytomyr Oblast reported to FAKTY.
After this, the man went to a café located nearby.
A conflict arose with him on the premises, during which the man discharged a device used to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the patrons.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and there is no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical services responded to the scene; however, by that time, the shooter had fled.
The man was unable to explain his actions.
The individual in custody faces imprisonment for a period of between 3 to 7 years.
You will recall that, on the night of July 28, an assault involving gunfire took place in Kiev in the Lukyanivka neighborhood near Tatarska Street.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
"She ended his life to better her own.
"She has shown no remorse."
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: “I let Langford go, like a high-flying bird”
One of the VTB United League’s best basketball players, 33-year-old Keith Langford, has left UNICS.
UNICS President Evgeny Bogachev commented on the departure of the American defenseman to Izvestia.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, Evgeny Bogachev said.
He has a small child and a wife who don’t want to move to Kazan.
And that’s why I let him go, like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning silver in the 2015-16 United League.
He earned an average of 21.75 points per match.
This result is the second highest since 2004, when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in EuroLeague history to receive this prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with China’s Shenzhen, Eurohoops informs.
Earlier, Panathinaikos’ former center, Ioannis Bourousis, moved to the Chinese CBA.
A sunburnt tourist from Moscow region was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
The man was vacationing at the Fisht camping shelter, which is situated at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had elevated blood pressure and was also having difficulty breathing.
The leader of the tour group, who said that the man had sustained a sunburn while hiking, contacted emergency response personnel.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
In Astrakhan, a café patron paid with counterfeit money
These types of crimes are punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to 8 years, with a fine in the amount of 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is urging residents of Astrakhan Oblast to be attentive when making financial transactions; it is recommended that employees of sales outlets install devices to determine the authenticity of money received.
Having studied the properties of the stratosphere of the giant exoplanet called WASP-121b for the first time, astrophysicists were more than a little surprised by its temperature, which is capable of vaporizing iron and other metals.
And a lot is at stake.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
The ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey and ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade, Alexander Semin, met with beginner hockey players the other day and signed autographs for fans.
50 schoolchildren took part in the event.
“It’s great that there’s a place in Krasnoyarsk like the 2019 Winter Universiade tent, where beginner athletes can ask team coaches questions in person”, the champion said.
It bears noting that the 2019 Winter Universiade ambassadors will help to promote student sport and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will continue to operate for the entire summer season, up until September 25, reports the press service for the 2019 Winter Universiade Directorate.
The State Department has commented on Medvedev’s words
The official spokesperson for the US State Department, Heather Nauert, commenting on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a briefing, spoke about the need to find “areas of cooperation” with Russia.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
That being said, Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev’s assertion about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Furthermore, the prime minister believes that the American establishment has “fully outwitted” Trump.
A bodybuilder, who went missing in the Moscow area, was found in a stranger’s dacha suffering from memory loss
Friends and local residents spent seven days unsuccessfully looking for him.
But Shamil was found at a stranger’s dacha in Ramensky.
The Dagestani athlete was unable to explain how he got there and what had happened to him.
He couldn’t even remember what his name was and his passport was missing.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil have probably already been to his apartment, the keys for which they also stole from him.
Oil and gas revenues for July have exceeded forecasts by 7.4 billion rubles
“In August 2017, the deviation of oil and gas revenues in the federal budget from the monthly estimate, according to the federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, is projected to be +40.2 billion rubles”, a Ministry of Finance statement says.
As such, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic foreign exchange market for the period of August 7 to September 6, 2017, amounts to RUB 47.6 billion.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
He left a wife and two adult children.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
It's a wrenching decision.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get into Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who formerly led Georgia and then Odessa Oblast in Ukraine, arrived by plane in Poland.
Furthermore, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili spoke at the event to commemorate the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against Hitler’s troops in 1944.
It is still unclear how he managed to make the transatlantic flight without documents.
Earlier, the former governor of Odessa Oblast, Mikheil Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the application form for Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The period of investigation for the case against Vainzikher and Olkhovik has been extended until January
The time period for the preliminary investigation into the case against the co-owner of the Renova group of companies, Yevgeny Olkhovik, and the head of T Plus energy holding, Boris Vainzikher, has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering the matter of extending house arrest for the accused parties.
“The particular complexity and duration of the investigation stems from the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large volume of documents, as well as carry out investigative measures in several constituent entities of the Russian Federation”, the investigator declared.
According to investigators, Vainzikher, Olkhovik, and the former head of CJSC Integrated Energy Systems, Mikhail Slobodin (who ran the company VimpelCom up until September 5), were handing over bribes to senior government officials in the Komi Republic in return for the establishment of extremely lucrative rates for thermal and electric power, as well as for the creation of favorable business conditions.
Vainzikher and Olkhovik were apprehended, transported to Syktyvkar, and held under arrest for two months; Slobodin has evaded investigators and was put on the federal wanted list.
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
It all just came."
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
It is our duty to win.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Team El Salvador football players Henry Romero and Darwin Cerén received long-term suspensions for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarterfinal match of the Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football’s (CONCACAF) Gold Cup, the Salvadorans bit American players.
Then, midfielder Cerén, during a corner kick in his penalty area, bit US defender Omar Gonzalez.
Consequently, Romero was suspended for three matches and Cerén for six.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"So never shut up."
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.
A fire in a 79-storey tower in Dubai has been put out
The massive blaze, which occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, has been put out, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to deal with all of the sources of fire by 4:00 a.m. local time (3:00 a.m. Moscow Time).
Local authorities reported that no one was hurt as a result of the incident.
The roads around the skyscraper were closed while the fire was being put out.
Earlier, it was reported that the 79-storey residential skyscraper in Dubai, The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, was on fire.
All the residents were evacuated in time.
Buzova’s jaw-dropping outfit shocks fans: pants that don’t cover panties
Olga Buzova, the scandalous host of the reality TV show “Home 2”, astounded spectators of the Europa Plus Live festival by dancing in panties.
The newly minted singer performed the song “We will be hot”, in a duet with Nastia Kudry, in front of thousands of fans.
The pants were inscribed with the names Buzova and Kudry.
Stoltenberg has acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
Radio 4 news service reported this on Friday, August 4, with reference to foreign media organizations.
That being said, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and that further escalation of the situation would not be beneficial to any of the parties involved.
In October, it will be possible to pay for travel on Yekaterinburg’s metro using a bankcard, the General Director of OAO I-Network, Pavel Vedernikov, announced in an interview with Oblastnaya Gazeta.
“We would like fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metropolitan using their bankcards, without having to get tokens or wait in line”, he said.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee attrition and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
Do you care?
Over at Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insight on its employees, and it's hoping that in the long run, this will convert to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
In Barnaul, the new asphalt on Krasnoarmeyskiy Prospekt is being dug up
In Barnaul, drastic measures have been taken to determine the reason for asphalt cave-ins on Krasnoarmeyskiy Prospekt.
To recap, the collapse of a small section of the road close to the tram tracks happened as a result of the ground sinking in the area of an abandoned and out-of-operation utilities network.
According to the deputy chair of the city committee for road facilities, improvements, transport, and communications, Ivan Garmat, they will conduct a thorough examination to achieve a detailed survey and eliminate the conditions that led to the collapse.
This is reported on the official website of the territory’s capital.
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
"We will have security," Mora said.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
We have a plan in place."
This was reported by the press service of Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospital, TV Tsentr reports.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarzhon Dzhalilov.
15 people died as a result of the terrorist attack, as did the perpetrator himself.
11 people were arrested on criminal charges, including the suspected mastermind, Abror Azimov.
You will recall that, the other day, Rospotrebnadzor recommended that the Saint Petersburg metropolitan reassess its action plan to ensure transport security, including increasing the number of walk-through metal detectors.
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.

"The Peasants' Revolt started in that area and I thought, a riot is a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
"I was sad to leave," he says.
But this isn’t just a departure: all the banks that have announced their break with the ARB are in negotiations with another non-governmental organization that unites credit institutions, the Association of Regional Banks of Russia, which is led by the well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakov, chair of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, who was, in fact, recognized at the end of the last session as the most effective Duma committee leader and deputy, in terms of the amount of draft legislation prepared.
The conflict inside of the ARB started during a discussion in the Federation Council, when new bills were being reviewed in the Interregional Banking Council, including those calling for a new classification of banks in relation to the size of their authorized capital.
Apparently, this exchange of conflicting opinions, in a banking environment that is highly sensitive to relations with the main regulator, was the apparent reason for the fifteen largest banks, having expressed their disagreement with ARB policies, to start preparing to join the “Russia” association, noting that the “efficacy of the ARB’s work is poor, and that there is virtually no constructive dialogue conducted within the banking association”.
Depositors will be better off
In human resources and organizational terms, it is also clear that no significant disturbances are expected.
That’s not to say that the “Russia” association is ready to welcome new members with open arms on any terms, judging from the reaction of its director, Anatoly Aksakov (“perhaps they want too much”), who, back on July 21, at a briefing at Parlamentskaya Gazeta’s press center, said that “the very next day, representatives from the banks that left the ARB were asking me to look at the possibility of expanding the potential of our ‘Russia’ association”.
The negotiation process is currently underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, and the agenda is being prepared for the association’s extraordinary congress, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international baking forum.
Furthermore, Anatoly Aksakov, making it clear that he “isn’t clinging to the position”, named Grigory Luntovsky, who is leaving his post as deputy chair of the Central Bank in September, as the possible new head of a revamped “Russia” association, having spoken highly of his professional and personal qualities.
The entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities in Russia will not be restricted
The deputy head of the Ministry of Transport, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities in Russia would not be restricted yet.
And there, the concept is to immediately move to zero emissions.
The question still is: as of what year?
“In 20 years time, I don’t know, maybe that might happen”, Prime quotes the minister as saying.
Earlier, Izvestia newspaper reported that Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich has been assigned to study, by August 17, proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, which were submitted to the government by the CEO of PJSC KAMAZ, Sergey Kogonin.

She also has moods during the day just like real people!
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but, right now, it doesn't feel like a large one.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
The Los Angeles native, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, competing for Team Ukraine since 2013, won’t be helping our national team in the European Basketball Championship, the final phase of which starts on August 31.
The general manager for the “blue-and-yellows”, Andrei Lebedev, spoke about this in an interview with the BeBasket website.
We will go to Eurobasket without the naturalized player, since we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
“This situation will give us an opportunity to develop our young players”, he said.
Let me remind you that, with Jeter’s direct involvement, Team Ukraine claimed a record sixth place for itself in Eurobasket 2013, and, for the first time, made it into the World Basketball Championship, where the “yellow-and-blues” were unable to make it past the group stage, but the US native averaged 15.4 points, three rebounds, and 5 assists per game.
Jeter stopped playing for Team Ukraine at the time of the departure of the head coach for our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The 2017 Men’s Eurobasket will be held in four countries at the same time: Turkey, Romania, Israel, and Finland.
As part of their training for the tournament, our men’s team played two friendly matches, which they lost to the Dutch and the Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
When we talk about "normalisation" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his antics may one day cease to appal.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The individual suspected of beating an NTV journalist has been ordered not to leave town
The capital’s law enforcement officials have imposed a pre-trial restraint in the form of travel restrictions on the man who assaulted an NTV television channel journalist, Nikita Razvozzhayev, during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
TASS reported this, citing the official spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, Irina Volk.
“As part of the criminal investigation initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Battery), in relation to the 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the television channels in the face in the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Leisure, a pre-trial restraint in the form of travel restrictions and proper conduct has been imposed on the suspect”, Volk clarified.
The spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for failure to obey the police has been drawn up in relation to the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast for Airborne Forces Day, an inebriated man walked up to the correspondent and hit him in the face.
According to Razvozzhayev, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
The same day they were released, while an investigation is currently underway.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose.
Statements made during US Vice President Michael Pence’s European tour came under criticism from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“Regretfully, it must be acknowledged that Washington is slipping ever deeper into the primitive ideologically driven clichés of the Cold War era, which are entirely detached from reality”, a statement from the Russian foreign policy establishment reads.
A paramedic was injured in a traffic accident with an ambulance in the Moscow area
The traffic accident happened in Stupino outside of the Moscow; a paramedic was injured as a result of the collision between an import vehicle and an ambulance.
“The ambulance vehicle flipped over as a result of the collision”, the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior for Moscow Region told TASS.
“Law enforcement officers and doctors responded to the scene and immediately transported the child to a medical facility”, the main office of the National Police in Odessa reported.
Medics determined that the boy was born just a few hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the presence of an umbilical cord.
The identity of the mother was determined during preliminary investigative and operational measures: a 36-year-old local resident.
As the main office noted, the family was not previously known to law enforcement officials and wasn’t registered with any particular authorities.
Currently, the newborn is under medical supervision.
One of the most successful entertainers on the Russian stage, Grigory Leps, is celebrating his 55th birthday this coming Sunday.
I remember how your “fiftieth” was marked.
Did your plans come to fruition?
Of course, today, I’m no longer the person I was, let’s say, 20 years ago.
Singing like I sang in my 30s is becoming more difficult.
It’s called “Why are you so serious?”, after a song by the same name, which was co-written with Timati.
But we’ll put the album out in November, for the series of my anniversary concerts at Moscow’s Crocus City Hall.
The first-rate American drummer, Chris Coleman, had a hand in your new record.
You, it seems, wanted to entice him to join your touring band?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most accomplished drummers in the world today.
However, for ongoing work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
We were talking about compensation between €35,000 and €45,000 per month.
Then, I thought that I would track down worthy musicians in the post-Soviet region.
And I found an excellent drummer, Max Malyshev.
At the end of the day, it’s better to feed your own people (smiling).
For example, the guitarist Feodor Dosymov is highly respected internationally.
Western music magazines write about him and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Right now, to be honest, I’m not doing anything.
As a musician, I am really very sorry that I can’t get into America.
The more you associate with real professionals, the better.
We’re no dumber than them, but we don’t have the same experience or schools.
Now, for some reason, Great Britain has banned me from entering for ten years.
Will you go to the Laima Vaikule Rendezvous Festival, which starts on July 20 in Jūrmala?
When will the third be out?
Probably next year.
I want to record around 80-90 of Vysotsky’s songs in the same manner of style he did himself.
I’m also going to try and entice Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to take part in the album.
Seryozha is a brilliant singer; I invited him to join me.
But Alexander Panayotov, whom I mentored in The Voice, is now with my center.
I’m hoping for a good outcome.
If they don’t reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
After that, they can go their own way if they want, and I won’t insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although, I would be pleased if one of them achieves commercial success and pays me the percentage we agreed to in the contract.
Let everyone work, find their way, and prove themselves like I proved myself a long time ago.
I still get invited to go there.
Generally, we’re talking about private events.
But in terms of a big tour…
I sincerely regret that we have this type of situation with Ukraine.
I also collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik…
But I think, at this time, it’s highly unlikely…
Andrei Okhlopkov has been transferred from the cosmodrome
It came to Kommersant’s attention that the technical director for the Vostochny Cosmodrome, Andrei Okhlopkov, has taken on a job at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (SSRPC).
There won’t be a replacement for Mr. Okhlopkov: the position of technical director will most likely be eliminated and the job responsibilities will be distributed across COSGBI’s divisions.
“He has been working in the new position for several weeks already”, clarified Kommersant’s industry sources.
It wasn’t possible to get a prompt response from COSGBI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, Kommersant’s information was officially confirmed by SSRPC.
He made the decision to transfer to the position of director for the coordination of operations, the enterprise stated. Andrei Okhlopkov, tasked with providing the minimum number of facilities required for the first launch at Vostochny Cosmodrome, fully accomplished this.
Mr. Okhlopkov started working at COSGBI in 2013, having service in the space forces under his belt, specifically at Baikonur and at Plesetsk (at the “northern” cosmodrome, he held the post of deputy commander with the rank of colonel).
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov was a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, at his behest, regional businessmen in Arkhangelsk Oblast and Komi Republic were receiving state orders for kickbacks, but they weren’t delivering on their commitments to clean the separable parts of the launch vehicle.
In 2012, a trial by jury found him not guilty.
In an interview with Kommersant, Oleg Ostapenko, who headed up the Federal Space Agency at that time, said frankly that the situation at Vostochny “was already critical in October 2013”.
The fact of the matter is that a strategic mistake was made during planning: the completion of construction and launch of the Soyuz 2.1 launch vehicle were scheduled for the very same time – the end of 2015.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
In spite of the substantial risks, and the fact that it was postponed anyhow (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz was only launched on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified in and of itself, says a Kommersant source at the cosmodrome: “Otherwise, we still wouldn’t have completed a single launch from Vostochny, but would be engaged in construction”.
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is overseeing the establishment of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his “space Susanin”, but more often than not, he was requesting information about the pace of construction from him specifically.
This idea found support within the government.
According to Kommersant, the reason for Mr. Okhlopkov’s transfer to a new place of work was a disagreement with COSGBI management about the means for completing construction of the cosmodrome’s facilities and complexes, as well as the methods of working with subcontractors.
According to Kommersant, this won’t be necessary: the position of technical director of the cosmodrome will be eliminated and its functions will be distributed across COSGBI’s divisions.
An educational program with two specializations is coming to music schools
“The Ministry of Culture has taken over responsibility for this issue and we, in cooperation with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will make it possible to earn two specializations, but that will not contravene existing legislation in the field of education”, Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin’s “Grown-Up Conversation” with pupils at the Sirius children’s center, Maria Andreeva, a schoolgirl, reported that she is required to pay for duplicate subjects for her second specialization at the Moscow Conservatory’s Central Music School.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
A 17-year-old Russian national, Kirill N., who climbed up the side of a high-rise building onto the roof, has been detained in Mexico, the El Universal website reports.
The youth, with the assistance of two unknown men, climbed over a three-meter fence into the grounds of the Nestle office building complex and climbed up one of its towers on his own.
In the meantime, the video with the young man climbing up the high-rise has become popular online.
Users have dubbed the youth, “Spiderman”.
According to the news media, these types of experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The former chairs of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkevičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats, Česlovas Juršėnas, urged their fellow party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As Parlamentskaya Gazeta reported, as a result of tensions with their partners –the Farmers and Greens Union – a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic party about whether to stay in the ruling coalition.
A fine has been imposed against the disabled man, Anton Mamayev
The Moscow City Court has mitigated punishment for the wheelchair-bound disabled man, Anton Mamayev, from four and a half years imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
The convicted defendant was released from a pretrial detention facility by an earlier decision of the Timiryazevsky Court.
Having said this, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he organized the robbery and theft of a motorized scooter from a former special forces soldier.
“Mamayev is the mastermind of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and as such, this individual should be convicted of a criminal offense”, the press secretary for the Moscow City Court, Ulyana Solopova, explained to Kommersant.
In addition to this, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which a punishment less than the minimum sentence can be imposed.
As for Mamayev’s accomplice, Vasily Seroshtanov, the court didn’t find facts that would have provided grounds for recategorizing the severity of the offense and changing the judgment.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, didn’t rule out an appeal of the judgment in a cassation proceeding through the Moscow City Court and in the Supreme Court.
“We will make use of all the levers of power, right up to the European Court of Human Rights”, he told RIA Novosti.
To recall, the 28-year-old Muscovite, Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, was the defendant in a criminal case in the fall of last year.
The disabled man contends that he bought the motorized scooter from an acquaintance for 160,000 rubles in order to then sell it.
However, the owners of the motorized scooter, which include a former special forces soldier, stated that the disabled man and his accomplice, Vasily Seroshtanov, took their property from them under the threat of violence.
On June 30, Moscow’s Timiryazevsky District Court sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in a penal colony and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years of imprisonment, with punishment to be served in a standard regime penal colony (in accordance with part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobile disabled man was placed in a pretrial detention facility, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, and the President’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Tatyana Moskalkova, got involved in the case.
As a result, Anton Mamayev was released from the pretrial detention facility in the middle of July, by a decision of the very same Timiryazevsky Court.
The All-Russia People’s Front’s (ONF) final “Action Forum” in 2017 will focus on environmental issues, a source in the ONF reported to Izvestia and the head of the movement’s executive committee, Alexey Anisimov, confirmed.
According to him, based on the results of the forum, members of the front plan to prepare a report for the president on domestic environmental issues, as well as suggest strategies to solve them.
According to Izvestia, ONF’s final forum will take place in the fall.
We will form comprehensive proposals to solve environmental issues based on the suggestions made and those that will be made at these events, a source in the ONF told Izvestia.
The ONF’s final environmental forum and “Action Forum” will most likely be combined.
All of this will go into the report that we are preparing for the president, in his capacity as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, members of the front will also report on work on the ONF’s priority projects, Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, the President’s Special Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology, and Transport, Sergei Ivanov, will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he took part in the work of the ONF’s Mediaforum, which was held in Saint Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will be consigned to history, but the most important thing that needs to be done right now is to set in motion environmental protection mechanisms so that they will work for many years to come.
The head of the regional politics laboratory at the Expert Institute of Social Studies (EISS), Andrey Kolyadin, noted that, by raising environmental issues, the ONF are acting inline with the presidential agenda.
Down the road, with the assistance of the ONF, regions could lobby not only for a solution to their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
Experts in the field of environmental studies are of the opinion that the legal framework for solving environmental issues in Russia has, by and large, been established: the crux of the matter is continued regulatory enforcement, as well as the position of civil society.
Firm implementation of decisions made by the state is essential, believes the head of the charitable foundation, Ecology for Everyone, Leonid Bochin.
As soon as society and business recognize that solving environmental issues is a far more beneficial step in the long term, the situation will change, Sergey Tsyplyonkov noted.
The expert stressed the necessity of overcoming the belief that a violation of environmental legislation is a cost-effective solution for business.

White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
But even official events have political overtones.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the city’s Yudin Clinical Hospital.
During the tour of the clinic, he presented a letter of recognition to orthopedic trauma surgeon Viktor Protsko, under whose direction an extremely difficult operation to reconstruct a teenager’s foot was conducted.
According to the capital’s mayor, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the biggest in Moscow today.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the site of the Kolomenskaya Village Hospital.
These days, the medical institution’s units are designed to accommodate more than a thousand patients.
The hospital’s staff amounts to 2,800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 ha.
They are designed for conducting relatively minor operations.
The NBU has reported a lack of buyers for Sberbank’s Ukrainian “offshoot”
The National Bank of Ukraine has reported an absence of bids to purchase Sberbank’s Ukrainian “offshoot”.
TASS, with reference to the spokesperson for NBU’s press service, reported about this on Friday, August 4.
“The NBU has not received paperwork for the purchase of Sberbank’s shares from other potential investors”, it is noted in a statement.
On August 3, the Belarusian businessman, Viktor Prokopenya, withdrew his bid to purchase Sberbank’s subsidiary.
On July 28, it came to light that the National Bank of Ukraine had barred Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov from acquiring Sberbank’s Ukrainian “offshoot”.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen didn’t provide the paperwork required to check their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
The majority shareholder of the consortium is Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the “offshoots” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which Sberbank found itself, were introduced in mid-March.

The files have been handed over to Moscow’s Presnensky District Court for consideration on the merits.
The fines for inappropriate conduct by tourists in Venice have been stiffened
From now on, they will issue a fine of 200 euros for walking around the city in a bathing suit or bare-chested.
“The problem is that Venice is thought of like a beach”, she noted.
Furthermore, a moratorium on the establishment of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice has been put in place.

The program for the second Skolkovo Jazz Science festival, which will take place on August 26 at the Skolkovo Innovation Center, has been announced.
Visitors can expect performances by leading jazz groups and soloists, scientific discussions, interactive installations, and other musical and intellectual activities.
“Festival visitors will be able to delve into the world of experimental media technology and discover how innovations in science are turning into new tools of collaboration with art”, Yelena Zelentsova, Vice President of the Skolkovo Foundation, described as the focus of the forum.
Jazz and science are related concepts and it is no accident that they were connected, the people’s artist explained to Izvestia.
One of the main events of the festival will be a performance by Azekel, a British citizen of Nigerian descent, who is known for both his own body of work and for his collaborative work with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
Jazz lovers are eagerly awaiting the first performance in Russia by the five-time Grammy nominated pianist, Christian Sands (USA), with his trio.
One of the most unusual festival performances promises to be the set by Sergei Kuryokhin award winner, Anton Maskeliadze.
The experimental artist conducts music and video using gestures: this is how leap motion technology works.
In total, eight musical groups will perform on two festival stages.
Additionally, the program includes open discussions, interactive zones, and art installations, united by the idea of merging music and science.
Visitors will be able to take part in experiments, visit a science buffet, and observe cryogenic ice cream or quicksand, made from cornstarch and water, being created.
The Federation Council has relieved Ozerov from the post of committee head
On Wednesday, the Federation Council approved the resignation letter of the chairperson for the Committee on Defense and Security, Viktor Ozerov, and relieved him of this post.
Ozerov wrote the application requesting to be relieved from his current post last week.
The country’s Federal Antimonopoly Service has set indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers in the Republic of Buryatia, in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation “On amendments to the rules of the wholesale market of electric energy and capacity and the consolidated balance forecast for production and delivery of electric energy (capacity), within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia, for constituent entities of the Russian Federation” (from 17.07.2017, No. 842).
As a consequence, the cost of electric energy for Buryat manufacturers is being reduced by a quarter, which will make life significantly easier for small and medium businesses and individual entrepreneurs.
In March, tariffs on electric energy for the republic’s population were reduced from RUB 4.24/kWh to RUB 3.93/kWh, or by 7.3%.
Scooter wasn’t frightened by the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
The group Scooter, a legend of electronic dance music, flew to Crimea unafraid of the threats from the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine.
“The flight went well, and tomorrow, I will hold a concert”, RIA Novosti quotes the group’s frontman, H.P. Baxxter, as saying.
Earlier, the German publication Bild, with reference to the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Evgeny Enin, reported that the musicians could face up to eight years imprisonment for travelling to Crimea, which Kiev considers as the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
Scooter’s performance at the festival in Balaklava, which is called #ZBFest, is planned for August 4.
#ZBFest is put on by the Zolotaya Balka company, in honor of International Champagne Day.
Their last album, “Ace”, came out in 2016.
Besides Scooter, Sergei Galanin and his group SerGa, as well as Garik Sukachev with Brigada S, will also perform as festival guests.
The premiere of the new season of “Game of Thrones” will take place in the Moscow Metro
Komsomolskaya Pravda’s website writes about this.
It’s known that the first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations, as a part of the “Night in the Metro” promotion.

A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
This is how Russian President Vladimir Putin replied to Igor Sechin’s request to assist in resolving conflicts that have emerged.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting concerning the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, stated that the absence of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for FEPCO put the timetable for the implementation of the project at risk.
You will recall that Rosneft was asking for permission to use gas from Gazprom’s Kirinskoye field, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Far East Petrochemical Company.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"We respect all clubs.
Putin has instructed that payments to victims of the forest fires be dealt with.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed that the financial assistance, which is being allocated to resident-victims of the forest fires and for the construction of new homes, be dealt with.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Nature Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Plenipotentiary Representative of Russian President for the Siberian Federal District, Sergey Meniailo, and the head of the Baikal branch of the Federal State Budgetary Institution, Glavrybvod, Leonid Mikhailik.
Then, they showed the fry in an open tank beside a container they had prepared for breeding.
First, Putin released several fry from a net.
During the trip, the leader also instructed that the environmental situation in Baikal be dealt with and that a road be built on Olkhon Island.
According to Ministry of Construction figures, a certain amount is needed, but allegedly, a different amount has been set aside.
“To be blunt, I want to get to the bottom of what is going on with the financing here”, the Russian leader stressed.
As RT television channel reports, the document, registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian parliament, stipulates a three-year prison sentence for citizens of Russia trying to get into the country’s territory illegally.
It is noted that the term of imprisonment can be increased to five years for repeat offenses or for an act committed by a group of individuals.

The borders and types of economic activities of the priority development area in the town of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia have been established.
In the town, which is home to 15,000 people, a special regulatory regime for entrepreneurial activity will be in effect, as well as a minimum amount of capital investment from residents, and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
There are also plans to reduce the area’s dependence on the town’s economic mainstay, OOO Abakan Mining Company.
In January 2017, regional authorities announced that Khakassia had met all of the Ministry of Economic Development’s conditions to create the priority development area.
The government of Orenburg Oblast also acted in a similar manner.
This will make it possible to diversify the economy of the single-industry town and reduce its dependence on the town’s economic mainstay, JSC Ural Steel, as well as create more than 2,300 jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
Novotroitsk was the first single-industry town in Orenburg Oblast to receive the priority development area status.
