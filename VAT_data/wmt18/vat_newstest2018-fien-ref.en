Camille Auer wanted to change her gender, was diagnosed with a mental illness and is now making art on the theme – "People should have the right to their own body"
Dozens of patient reports are hanging from the ceiling of the Project Room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
The reports tell a long story of what kind of an interpretation other people have written of Auer and her identity –
The Act on the Legal Recognition of the Gender of Transsexuals (563/2002), or the trans act, obligates transgender people to a compulsory sterilisation so that their correct gender can be registered, for example, in the Population Register Centre and their passport.
The front of the exhibition area is dominated by two large installations.
The psychologist met Camille Auer two times and, on the basis of these meetings, wrote a report that would define Auer's rights to receive treatment and assistance.
Auer does not recognise herself from these reports.
"It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill", Auer says.
According to the nursing staff, she did not have sufficient resources to start the process.
Later, that TV evolved into a Monument for the Excluded, a work of art through which Auer reflects on her experiences in power and how it is exercised.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.
For many, a gender reassignment process is tougher mentally than physically as a result of medical operations.
Auer's personal exhibit also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the exhibition brochure, Auer writes: "I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and this is something people find hard to accept."
Being seen is a basic need.
Currently, Auer feels that she is seen, and exists as a woman.
However, in the first phases of the process, random comments by people close to her hurt.
What hurts me the most is when people close to me define my gender incorrectly.
However, not all transgender people want physical alterations.
They do not suffer from the body dysmorphic disorder, whereby their body or its parts can cause anxiety or even physical pain.
For example, in Denmark, Parliament approved a new procedure for identifying the legal gender in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right of self-determination when it comes to the legal gender.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to clarify the CEO's additional pension
Yle reports that Mika Lintilä (Centre Party), Minister of Economic Affairs in charge of Government ownership steering, has asked Finnair to clarify the additional pension paid to CEO Pekka Vauramo.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's additional pension in February.
The state holds more than half of Finnair.
So far, the most stunning response has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev who said that the sanctions bill signed by Trump will result in a "full-scale trade war."
Even if the Russian responses were shrugged off merely as exaggerations and aggravations belonging to political rhetoric, the increased tension between the USA and Russia is a fact, following the short honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the USA, passing the sanctions act concerning Russia, Iran and North Korea was no simple process.
Soon after signing the bill, Trump criticised it as being "significantly incomplete."
As is widely known, the USA is investigating Russia's possible involvement in the presidential election and any links between Trump's campaign and Russia.
The EU has visibly highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relationship with Russia and demanded the execution of the Minsk Protocol.
For a member state such as Finland that trades frequently with Russia, economic sanctions are a constant nuisance.
The impact of the new US sanctions act remains unclear.
Another cause of sourness in Europe is that liquefied natural gas, which is important for US finances, has been excluded from the sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a global way of showing disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and accurate,
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
As for my captain's speech?
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
But he did not silence his critics.
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.
But he did not silence them.

Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Possible indoor climate problems investigated in Säkylä
Investigations are still in progress.
The investigations started after a man had to interrupt his military service as he suspected that his state of health deteriorated due to the poor indoor climate at the barracks.
According to lieutenant colonel Mika Holma, chief of staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems regarding the health of other conscripts.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I'm tired."
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Dereck Chisora attacks Robert Helenius for cancelling their rematch: "Not even his fans want to see him fight"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were set to fight at Hartwall Arena on 27 May.
In a recent interview for IFL TV, Chisora lays all the blame on Helenius for the cancellation.
Helenius and Chisora had their first fight at a fully packed Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Ticket sales for the rematch were slow, and promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the fight was postponed to autumn.
However, Chisora is no longer sorry about the cancellation.
As it happens, the fight would have been cancelled anyway, as Chisora was ill.
My hernia was about to blow up.
He does not seem to be interested in a rematch with Helenius, as he has his eyes set on Dillian Whyte.
Whyte beat Chisora in December on a split decision.

More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."
Supercar manufacturer to launch an SUV – "in Ferrari's style"
The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) announced that the measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same virus type as the previous cases in eastern Savonia.
However, it's possible that new infections will be discovered after this fifth case until the middle of August, and the danger isn't over yet", says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, physician in charge of infectious diseases in basic healthcare services at Sosteri.
No new measles infections or suspicions of new cases have been discovered after the fifth case.
"However, it's still important that everyone ensures that they are properly vaccinated", Erkkilä says.

Kilju is prepared through fermentation, while moonshine is made by means of distillation.
Tuominen says that there will be a simple rule to regulate the production of alcoholic beverages at home: alcohol can be made at home if it is fermented.
"The new act removes any requirements related to flavouring substances and permits the preparation of kilju", Mäkelä specifies.
"Making kilju is no longer a problem related to national health in Finland", Tuominen says.
The plenary session will be on 5 September.
The new act will enter into force from the beginning of 2018.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence at the Atteridgeville prison.
The press officer of the Pistorius family stated that the former top athlete is feeling fine.

Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
Brooks put it more succinctly.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
He's alarmed, confused.
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks on every other word.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Tearing vegetables in shops heats up feelings: This is how much you can actually save by removing "extra parts"
People are divided: for some, this is an indication of extreme stinginess, some do not want to pay for the parts that they will not use and that they would throw away anyway.
For example, empty cardboard boxes have been placed in the vegetable section of K-Citymarket Ruoholahti in Helsinki because many, for example, remove cauliflower leaves.
When placed in these boxes, the leaves are then disposed of as biowaste.
How much can you really save by removing unnecessary parts before weighing?
How effective is this really?
Me Naiset magazine tested what the price of a pineapple, artichoke, mushroom, broccoli and cauliflower is after any unnecessary parts are removed.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower originally EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80 after all the leaves were removed.
In percentage terms, the price decreased by as much as 20 per cent.
Earlier in Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the release fee of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona playing in the Spanish Primera División.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
In a press release, Barcelona announced that it will send information about the fee to the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) so that it can define any disciplinary actions resulting from the transfer.
UEFA has the right to impose sanctions on a club that produces losses of more than EUR 30 million over a period of three years.
According to UEFA, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate these rules.
UEFA stated that PSG may, for example, sell players at significant fees.

Austin, 21, badly burnt by lightning – flash recorded by airport security camera
Dunn was rushed to hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.

According to a representative of the airport, the lightning warning system was on at the time of the accident, and forwarding companies can independently decide whether or not to follow it.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.
Sydney Morning Herald reports that one of the leaders of Isis had also sent parts of a bomb to Sydney.
The police have not disclosed any details of why the attempt failed.
Michael Phelan, a deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, says that this was one of the most professional plans ever witnessed in Australia.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also be continued later.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refining company Neste's profit before taxes decreased, while still being above expectations during the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company reached good results in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products were record high and the net sales of the Marketing & Services segment developed positively.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained high this year as a result of higher sales volumes and favourable market conditions, even after the discontinuation of the tax concession.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
The quality of investment advice has raised much debate.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat wrote about Ritva, 68, to whom an investment advisor of a banking firm talked complete nonsense when selling investment products.
Regulations governing investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
Currently, the evaluation of the competence of investment advisors and employees who sell investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
Its website says that both of its examinations have "fairly extensive requirements."
Markku Savikko, managing director of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, says that roughly 70 per cent of those who take the examinations pass.
"When it comes to the largest banks, nearly all of their employees who sell investment services have completed either APV1 or APV2 qualifications, as this is a mandatory requirement set out in their own rules.
Savikko says that, since 2000, 13,000–14,000 people have completed APV1 qualifications, while roughly 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisors.
Savikko says that the FFI recommendation requires that APV qualifications are completed, as they secure investment-related competence.
Investment advice in accordance with the Act on Investment Services can only be offered by a licensed company.
Many other business fields are regulated by much stricter competence requirements", Savikko says.
According to Savikko, regulations will become stricter from the beginning of next year as a result of the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).
Marko Hovi, senior market supervisor at the Financial Supervisory Authority, says that one of the most significant changes is the requirement for the competence and experience of investment advisors and employees who sell investment products.
According to Hovi, the new requirements apply to the staff of investment service companies and their partner agents who sell products on their behalf.
All of this needs to be documented, and companies will be obligated to prove that this has been done.
According to Hovi, another addition is the requirement to work for a specific period with a more experienced employee, if a person's competence or experience is not at a sufficient level.
According to Hovi, these changes will make the regulations stricter and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter from the beginning of 2018.

Taina Itkonen watched as Iines Kaikkonen moved forward at a good pace.
"As schools and pre-schools start next week, we will have fewer students", Itkonen says.
Iines Kaikkonen, 5, first had her doubts about going deeper.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to swim towards the shore.
Well done!
Iines Kaikkonen says that she has swum a lot this summer.
Vili Huhtanen, 5, also trained hard using a pool noodle.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted to have a water fight.
Ilona Villberg, who watched how her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, was doing, thinks that an outdoor swim school is a good opportunity to learn how to swim.
The students gathered on the pier.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg placed their towels on the pier, had some fruit and enjoyed the sunshine.
The Unknown Soldier sells toilet brushes – "There's a unifying story"
Two days ago, Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product range,
that is, dish brushes, towel racks and "a toilet brush a rim cleaner."
What does Aino Määttä, vice president at Sinituote, have to say?
Our aim was to support Finnish production and a cult film", Määttä says.
"There's a unifying story in that we are a Finnish company and these are Finnish products", Määttä says.
"What is more, cleaning is not that unusual in the army", Määttä points out.
So far, Hartwall has launched carbonated water under the names of Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Kalle Kinnunen who writes a blog for Suomen Kuvalehti has already talked about products linked with the Unknown Soldier.
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
Ilonen comes down 30 places in Scotland
A five-over-par third round caused Mikko Ilonen to lose 30 places in a European Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen was tied for 11th before starting his round on Saturday, but ended up being tied for 41st after the round.
In difficult conditions, Ilonen scored three bogeys and one double bogey.
Ian Poulter from the UK rose to tie the lead after his -1 round, even though he said that he had more than enough work to do just to hold his umbrella.
He ties the lead with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
The rally erupted in cheers.
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Lightning wreaks havoc – summer's most intense thunderstorms expected for Thursday
At the end of the week, thunderstorms will also reach southern Finland.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, strokes of lightning ignited several fires.
Thundershowers have finally found their way to Finland.
The rescue department obtained information about the fire 15 minutes before midnight on Wednesday.
The distribution board was located in a sauna at the end of the terraced house.
Rescue personnel dismantled parts of the roof and wall in order to locate any fire pockets and extinguished the fire quickly.
In Loimaa, lightning set a shed on fire in Harjulantie a little before midnight.
The shed of roughly 50 square metres burned to the ground.
In Rääkkylä near Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house.
The rescue personnel arrived on site to investigate the situation, but this time the lightning did not cause any fire – it only burnt some fuses.
In traffic, thunderstorms caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when a stroke of lightning damaged the traffic control system.
Information about the fault was obtained on Thursday morning between 8 and 9 am, after which scheduled traffic was replaced by buses.
Thunderstorms have wreaked havoc in different parts of Finland.
"This summer's thunderstorms have been utterly rubbish!" says meteorologist Jari Tuovinen from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
On Wednesday, there were 1,700 flashes of cloud-to-ground lightning, and this summer's most intense thunderstorms are expected for Thursday: by 4 pm, there have already been 1,790 flashes of lightning.
"If the storms extend to the evening, we can have more than 2,000 flashes", Tuovinen says.
The previous record-low lightning year was in 2015 when the flash counter showed a total of 30,000 flashes.
By Wednesday, there have been 18,386 flashes this year.
There is still some catching up to do in order not to break the "record" made two years ago.
However, more storms can be expected.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will be warm and dry throughout the week, forming an ideal environment for thunderstorms.
More constant rain is expected in central parts of Finland.
According to Tuovinen, such weather rarely generates lightning.
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.
Production company disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland
"If we're being honest, I'm disappointed", admits Annika Sucksdorff, CEO of Helsinki Film, the film's production company, to Yle.
The film premiered in February 2017.
Tom of Finland was directed by Dome Karukoski.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Hurry up: Coach of Finnish World Championships athletes stuck in Helsinki
Suren Ghazaryan, coach of long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä, is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching in the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without hearing the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualification tomorrow and Mäkelä in the triple jump qualification on Saturday.
Their coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not obtained a visa for the UK.
Ghazaryan has visited the British Embassy to take care of the matter, but to no avail.
"I don't know if this is the first symptom of Brexit or what", team leader Jorma Kemppainen said.
Ghazaryan has worked at the Finnish Athletics Federation for years.
as long as someone makes sure that my check marks are correct at the stadium", Arttu Pajulahti commented on his coach's possible stay at home.
Medal for Finland from World Championships in London like a miracle
Luckily, nearly anything can happen in sports.
by Tero Pitkämäki in javelin.
The most hopeful ones are expecting Pitkämäki to bring home another medal, even though the results of Pitkämäki and other throwers, as well as his elimination from the finals in European Championships last summer, say otherwise.
No matter what happens in this competition, Pitkämäki will remain in history as one of the great Finnish sports heroes.
For other Finnish athletes, reaching the finals or making a personal best would be a good result.
Enni Rukajärvi second in big air in Copper Mountain – "It was so close"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi finished second in big air in a World Cup competition in Colorado.
This second place in Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best result in big air in the World Cup.
The competition was won by Jamie Anderson from the USA.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points.
But I will try it again in other competitions", Rukajärvi said.
In big air, competitors perform tricks after launching off very large jumps.
Viking Line's new fast ship stuck in port in Helsinki
Viking Line's new fast ship FSTR is badly behind schedule.
The ship was set to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 pm.
Now, the line of cars is moving slowly", said Johannes Rebane from Estonia waiting for embarkation at the Port of Helsinki at 7:30 pm.
Rebane said that employees of the shipping company had provided those waiting for embarkation in their cars with water bottles.
Christa Grönlund, press manager of Viking Line, said to IS that the ship had a technical fault.
The ship will depart from Helsinki a few hours behind schedule.
Grönlund said that the ship will also be a few hours late when returning from Tallinn.
The ship was set to return from Tallinn to Helsinki at 8:15 pm.
A 42-metre oversize transport disturbs traffic on main road 6 on Thursday evening
Police officers will direct traffic on main road 6, and traffic may be stopped occasionally.
From Mälkiä, the transport will head to the Port of Mustola along road 13.
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
But it's not much more than an idea.
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola is ready to fight in Macau on Saturday – against a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru will face a tough opponent in Macao, as Leandro Issa from Brazil fought in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) last year.
Tauru has never experienced anything like this before.
In some of his previous fights, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths were in stand-up fighting.
Tauru's last fight did not go according to plan.
Kevin Belingon from the Philippines landed a nasty blow in the corner of Tauru's eye and claimed the win.
Some fighters have a few matches a year, while some fight more frequently.
This will be the second fight of the year.
The pace has felt heavy at times.
However, I've only fought for the sake of fighting."
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming face-off, he felt that he needed a change of scenery.
Macau is an attractive location for Tauru who has also fought in China before.
"I've heard that it's the Las Vegas of China.
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
Pregnant Princess Sofia was radiant in her summer look
Princess Sofia choice of dress was spot on.
The Princess had chosen a beautiful light blue dress for the dinner of A Sustainable Tomorrow event.
Sofia was full of smiles.
On Wednesday, Sofia made an appearance at A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar wearing a stunning close-fitting blue dress that looked amazing on the soon-to-give-birth Princess.
Sofia arrived at the event wearing a dark blue dress.
Her due date is in September.
Sofia complemented her look with a small handbag.
Sofia looked radiant in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even entered into a conversation with photographers.
She teaches us with sweet chilli
In summer 1996, a booth was set up in the Lahti market square selling Thai food.
The booth was set up by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, or Panja to those who knows her.
Because people didn't have the courage to go and eat, Panja offered free bites.
And so she taught everyone living in Lahti how to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
I was immediately hooked.
I used to go more often, eventually every day.
In summer 1997, Panja opened a Thai restaurant in the Lahti market hall.
Panja knows her customers.
We tell her how we are doing, where we have been and who we have seen.
She remembers the name of the man with whom I had my first spring rolls.
She remembers when I was skinny and when I was fat, and she knows what I was like when I was younger.
It's nice to have lunch after everyone else, take a seat in my own place next to the kitchen door and talk this and that with Panja who is leaning on the bar.
In addition to our sense of taste, she has opened up our hearts and minds.
I admire Panja.
Earlier this year, security authorities got their hands on a significant list considering the battle against terrorism.
Of the listed persons, 130 come from Iraq, but there are also six Europeans
Ilta-Sanomat reported the discovery of the list two weeks ago.
Now, the location where the list was found and the information it contains have been specified.
The list also specifies the specialty of each terrorist.
The list says that he left Germany in 2012, going first to Egypt, followed by Libya and Turkey, before he went to Syria to join Isis.
It is not known what has happened to him.
Man went under water in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
A drowning man was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, on-call fire and rescue officer from the Helsinki rescue department, the situation was quickly over.
The rescue department was alerted after 3:30 pm.
Estlander says that the man was close to 50 years of age.
On the basis of interviews, the man wanted to show that he had the strength to swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
This was a mission led by the Border Guard.
Those present also gave excellent advice to divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police department.
Two cars collided in Eura – nine people in the two cars, three seriously injured
The on-call fire and rescue officer says that there were a total of nine people in the two cars, the rest of whom suffered more minor injuries.
The accident took place at an intersection of three roads at 4 pm.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
Earlier on Thursday evening it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid the release fee of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona playing in the Spanish Primera División.

Enraged people surrounded crashed plane in Portugal
Men who made emergency landing on a packed beach in Portugal were heard at court today.
The two men who piloted the plane may be indicted for negligent homicide.
The plane first hit the man who had his back turned towards the plane.
Filipe Janeira who was at the beach told Jornal de Noticias that immediately afterwards the plane ascended and, when it descended again, it hit the child in the head.
The deceased girl was at the beach with her parents
who were not injured.
Immediately after the crash, enraged people surrounded the crashed plane.
Celia Rocha who witnessed the incident told Correio de Manha that the girl's father and other people ran to the plane and started banging on its rear.
The man called the pilot a criminal – he was desperate.
It is a wonder that no more people were killed.
Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won another gold medal in World Championships: "Without the accident, I wouldn't be the World Champion"
Early on Wednesday morning, Matti Suur-Hamari won the gold medal in the banked slalom event in the World Championships held in Big White, Canada.
According to Suur-Hamari, the number of challengers is constantly increasing.
Every competition seems to have a different winner."
Suur-Hamari lost one of his legs in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He has always been an enthusiastic snowboarder ever since his childhood and the accident could not keep him off the slopes.
You play the hand you're dealt", Suur-Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to say that the serious accident and losing a leg were a stroke of luck, and Suur-Hamari does not.
However, he was able to turn his difficulty into an advantage.
When I was younger, I trained with my friends, and we were always watching the X-Games.
According to Suur-Hamari, this recognition is an important signal for parasports.
This will undoubtedly turn eyes towards parasports."
When will be the time to launch the campaign for selecting two-time World Champion Matti Suur-Hamari the Athlete of the Year?
"We'll see.
The Trump administration is not expected to bring about a change to the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, a global public relations and communications firm, conducted an international survey to identify the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees.
Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of young people in Arab countries during nine years.
In February and March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18–24 responded to the survey. Half of these were women and half were men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the survey, key factors among young Syrians are the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Less than ten per cent mentioned an improved financial situation or the exit of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the most critical factor.
A little more than 25 per cent thought that the presidency of al-Assad is an obstacle to a peace treaty.
Nearly half of all respondents felt that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Only a little more than 25 per cent considered that military action alone can resolve the conflict.
The majority of young Syrian refugees saw that Isis has lost power over the past year, whereas 20 per cent felt that its power has increased.
Nearly as many respondents mentioned military actions and an educational reform as primary means.
A little more than ten per cent thought that the most important factor would be to create better paying jobs for young people.
Nearly 25 per cent believed that the Syrian conflict will get worse during Trump's presidency.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding in Kauniainen to keep the internet in perfect order – his database is used by Wikipedia and Google
The main product of MariaDB, established by coder and entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, is free of charge for its users, and it can be developed by any skilled programmer through the Internet.
With databases, huge volumes of data can be kept in order and quickly available.
"All information that is not in image format, comes from a database, and that is where images are also linked", Widenius says.
Widenius, who works as the CTO of MariaDB, spends half of his time coding.
Working remotely from Kauniainen, Widenius makes sure that the Internet works as it should.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL at a price of one billion dollars and, a year later, software giant Oracle acquired Sun at 7.4 billion dollars.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle which didn't give a definite promise of the future of MySQL", Widenius says.
A foundation was set up to supervise that the code of MariaDB can be developed freely.
Even though many have heard of Widenius and the billion dollar MySQL deal, not many in Finland know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, we've ground by about 50 per cent a year", says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO at MariaDB.
Because the database is free of charge, the company has developed auxiliary services for which corporate customers are ready to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which may take more than a year if a customer has used a closed database.
A switch from MySQL to MariaDB is quick and easy, as the two are different versions of each other.
For example, Telefónica, a Spanish telecom operator, and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are paying customers of MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB spreads automatically to new users through Linux operating system packages in which MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecom operators, game developers, banks and even a few central banks", Paqvalén says.
The database market is still dominated by giants, such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP, with their closed databases.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to do, with fewer customers", Widenius says.
Last spring, MariaDB acquired a loan of 25 million euros from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
This was the largest growth loan ever given by the EIB in the Nordic countries.
The company has 115 employees around the world, and it intends to hire more.
One reason for obtaining funding from the EIB was the impact MariaDB has on public IT procurement.

Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.
He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of murdering his spouse in Enontekiö, suspect found in open country – case forwarded to the prosecutor
The suspected crime took place in Kuttanen, Enontekiö, last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of murdering his 26-year-old Scottish spouse.
It was reported earlier that both were seasonal workers.
The case may be handled in the District Court of Lapland as early as in August.
His death was reported by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy started acting in theatres at the age of 24.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
"She has shown no remorse."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
NATO Secretary General: Worst relations with Russia since the Cold War
Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, commented on Thursday that relations between NATO and Russia have become significantly colder.
But particularly after the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued Russian destabilisation of eastern Ukraine, the relationship between NATO and Russia has deteriorated considerably."
According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to avoiding a further spike in tensions.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Tibisay Lucenan, chair of the national election committee told reporters that this is an unprecedented opinion from a company which has no role in the election results.
The opposition has already strongly criticised the elections and organised protests.
According to El Pais, national security forces started to take hold of the parliament building in Wednesday evening, local time.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
And a lot is at stake.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
Trusting one's instincts.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project starts with a huge setback – "It's tough"
However, the training period had a catastrophic start when Manninen caught the flu.
In practice, Manninen was ill throughout May.
It was tough – I was hungry for training, but I just wasn't able to do anything", Manninen says to Ilta-Sanomat.
The gold medallist in 2007 World Championships was only allowed to train during the second week of June. This was reflected in the results of the treadmill test conducted by KIHU – the Research Institute for Olympic Sports – on 12 June.
Heading in a better direction
After initial difficulties, Manninen says that he has stayed healthy.
Manninen and Petter Kukkonen, head coach of the national team, have prepared a training and racing plan up to February.
The Olympics in PyeongChang would be the sixth Winter Games for Manninen.
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
It is our duty to win.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Moffatt was sentenced to 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for his threats to blow up an Islamic bookshop and "kill all the Muslims" in London.
According to the police, the staff of the bookshop called the police on 23 May,
The threat did not have anything to do with the events in the bookshop.
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic", Moffatt told the police during interrogations.
Moffatt was sentenced to 100 hours of unpaid community service and to pay legal expenses of GBP 620, or EUR 690, and compensation of GBP 85, or EUR 95, to the victims.
According to a Scotland Yard press officer, hate crimes are often left unreported.
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
British organisation sceptical about beloved Finnish innovation: "no evidence" of health benefits of maternity package
A British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish maternity packages.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduced the risk of sudden infant death,
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes distributed in Scotland fulfil all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard set for cardboard boxes acting as beds.
According to Lullaby Trust, the package may be the best option for a place to sleep if no bassinet or crib is available.
The organisation only recommends the package for naps and advises that its use should be stopped when the baby is able to turn to their side.
Staff at a Japanese zoo looking for an escaped tortoise.
The quickness of the giant tortoise has taken the staff by surprise, as the tortoise made its second escape in two weeks.
The tortoise escaped from the Shibukawa zoo located in Okayama in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
"It won't die quickly because it'll eat grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned", says Yoshimi Yamane, a zoo employee.
During opening hours, the tortoise is allowed to move around freely in the zoo.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness accounts of the tortoise.
Yamane discovered it walking on a road some 150 m from the zoo.
"I saw it on my way to the zoo.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
TT news agency reports that a 20-year-old man is suspected of taking videos of his naked neighbour without her consent in Sweden.
The woman living in Gothenburg had gotten out of the shower at her home when she noticed a mobile phone suspended from a cord outside her window.
The startled woman ran into another room to put some clothes on.
During interrogations, the man admitted to shooting the video, but denied being guilty of any crime.
Teachers demand more money during autumn negotiations
In the municipal sector, agreements are only possible after similar agreements have been signed in the private sector and any increases in them are known.
Luukkainen estimates that OAJ will reach an agreement on employment terms in January.
Luukkainen is also the president of the Negotiation Organisation for Public Sector Professionals (JUKO).
Luukkainen: Holiday pay cuts increase differences in income development
According to OAJ, statistics and estimates indicate that the purchasing power of public sector employees will decrease, while that of private sector employees will increase.
Luukkainen says that temporary holiday pay cuts increase these differences further.
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
Freedom in Rwanda
That was when the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) stopped the genocide organised by Hutu extremists.
Kagame has been criticised, for example, for crushing the opposition and limiting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics.
During his presidency, social reforms have been made and international investments have flown into the country.
What is more, Kagame has played an important part in unifying the country divided by the genocide.
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking feature was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
Maybe the two are connected?"

Wladimir Klitschko retires – no rematch against Anthony Joshua
Long-time heavyweight champion in professional boxing Wladimir Klitschko retires.
Ukrainian Klitschko, 41, announced his retirement on Thursday morning.
Tyson Fury beat him by the unanimous decision of the judges in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost the fierce fight via technical knockout in the 11th round.
However, Klitschko was unable to find motivation for the fight.
Therefore this is definitively the right decision", Bönte said.
Since 2009, Klitschko has been with American actress Hayden Panettiere.
They have one child, Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion.
In 2008–2012, the two brothers dominated international boxing by holding the titles of different boxing federations at the same time.
Pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the weather conditions during this summer season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the weather conditions.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
This summer, weather conditions have been against pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen.
"I wouldn't like to blame the track, but it's inconceivable that I couldn't even get my shorter poles working properly", Nikkanen said after her competition in Innsbruck.
There's no point in consuming energy in bad conditions."
She reached the World Championships thanks to jumping 455 indoors.
The conditions are not the same for everyone in London.
It is important to stay patient and wait for better winds.
Why won't you train abroad?
Normally, I've been able to train indoors, but now the facility has been closed."
Erkki Virtanen, an experienced government official who prepared budgets in the Ministry of Finance for decades warns that, despite the positive economic atmosphere, the Government of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä must keep its cool and be careful not to increase the state budget with borrowed money.
Yle interviewed Virtanen, who retired in 2015, in Ykkösaamu on Wednesday.
Virtanen regards the recent proposals of politicians for increasing the standard pension, decreasing car taxes and supporting electric bikes as election rhetoric.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US issues Green Cards to citizens from other countries.

A moment of horror on the road: Nearly hit by a car on the highway
Tommi was driving with his spouse and their two small children.
The incident took place near Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from Ring Road III roadwork site.
Tommi from Vantaa says it was a miracle that their family survived the car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his spouse Riina and their two small children were driving on the highway near Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
The family's car hit the median barrier at high speed.
One of the children is almost three years old, and the other is under 12 months of age.
The accident took place at 5:20 pm.
They were able to get out of the car without help.
According to Tommi, they will not receive any insurance compensation, unless they obtain the details of the other car.
Tommi saw that the other car was white and a little older,
probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
Tommi hopes that anyone who witnessed the accident or knows something about it contacts the police.
Persons contacted from the Itä-Uusimaa police department and the Keski-Uusimaa rescue department confirm that they were at the accident site on Tuesday evening.
Show directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with relationships by means of comedy – Itsensäpaljastelija will be performed at Mikä? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first theatre production as a director to the Mikä? Theatre.
Director Lotta Jäppinen says that it will still make audiences feel good.
"The themes are dealt with by means of comedy.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre show has been produced with a small budget, but with a big young heart.
The name of the show challenges its audiences to think what we expose of ourselves when we meet new people.
Jäppinen has both directed the show and adapted it for the stage.
Jäppinen emphasises that Itensäpaljastelija does not express her own relationships or those of the working group.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen thinks that Itsensäpaljastelija draws a topical picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
She says that many have learned about relationships from their parents, many of whom are divorced –
The show is performed by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
Music has been arranged by Jäppinen and Rokka.
Love for the theatre ignited in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola is studying at the Arts Academy of Turku University of Applied Sciences to become a director of theatrical performance.
Jäppinen fell in love with the theatre during her years in Kouvola.
Specialising in music during her school years, she has worked as an assistant at Kouvola Theatre and acted, for example, at Ylioppilasteatteri student theatre in Helsinki and, most recently, at Linnateatteri theatre in Turku.

Finnish Olympic winner took one year to recover from a terrible motocross accident – cervical spine fractured
Not many Finnish athletes are the unstoppable force of nature that is Janne Lahtela.
There's always something new", Lahtela says.
In the end, one sport nearly stopped Lahtela for good.
In 2014, he was in a motocross accident,
But I wasn't trying to find any limits.
After the accident, Lahtela was in an unusual situation.
Lahtela started in this position immediately after his career ended in 2006.
When he worked as a coach, Lahtela often challenged his athletes in the slopes and physical condition tests.
The forced break inspired Lahtela to start as the head coach of Team Finland.
If he had not had to stop, he might have burnt out.
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realised that I needed so much rest."
Lahtela started as the head coach of the national freestyle team of Finland a year ago.
"I replaced motocross with disc golf!
It all got out of hand right away.
At worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing."
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create as much of a physical likeness to actual women (albeit with porn star proportions) as technologically possible.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
A leader of the terrorist organisation Isis led a group of Australian men who are suspected of planning to take a bomb on board an Etihad Airways plane.
Sydney Morning Herald reports that one of the leaders of Isis had also sent parts of a bomb to Sydney.
The police have not disclosed any details of why the attempt failed.
Michael Phelan, a deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, says that this was one of the most professional plans ever witnessed in Australia.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also be continued later.
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and who's long been at loggerheads with Republicans in our family, has been visiting me in New York this week.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
There is an even scarier long-range scenario, however, in which what Trump "normalises" are rightwing Republicans who, held up against his standards, suddenly seem the epitome of reasonable.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
In a department store this week, on the other hand, I was required, before swiping my credit card, to rate my transactional "experience" on a scale of one to five stars.
Shefki Kuqi sacked by Inter – "No trust among directors"
Today, FC Inter released head coach Shefki Kuqi.
Kuqi will be replaced by his former assistant Fabrizio Piccareta.
Other members of the coaching staff will continue in their current positions.
Italian Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach, for example, in Sunderland in the UK.
Piccareta, 51, who joined Inter's coaching staff in January, completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, chairman of the Board of Directors of FC Inter, feels sorry about the situation.
However, Shefki Kuqi didn't enjoy the trust of the club's directors, and there was no other choice", Håkans commented in the club's press release.
Piccareta's agreement extends until the end of the season.
According to sources of Ilta-Sanomat, tensions have been high within the team throughout Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that his assistants Piccareta and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta had an altercation when Inter faced PS Kemi last Saturday.

Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.

Reuters: A grand jury has already issued indictments related to Trump Jr.'s meeting in Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has issued indictments with regard to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian legal counsel.
The grand jury, summoned by special counsel Robert Mueller, has already issued indictments relating to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian legal counsel famous for her Kremlin connections.
This was reported by Reuters which also confirms the information revealed by Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday about summoning a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has issued indictments relating to the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin connections, organised during the US presidential elections in June 2016.
Others present at the meeting were Paul Manafort, the then campaign manager of Donald Trump, and Jared Kushner, the current senior advisor to his father-in-law, Donald Trump.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, issue indictments and force people to testify under oath.
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.

Russian man extradited from Finland was sentenced to four years of imprisonment in the USA
On Thursday, the District Court of Minneapolis in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senakh to nearly four years of imprisonment for his involvement in a global computer fraud.
Senakh was apprehended in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a claim issued by the USA.
According to Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senakh was on holiday in Finland.
Senakh was sentenced to 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the US Department of Justice, Senakh will be expelled once he has served his sentence.
The virus was then used to phish usernames and passwords.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, this case indicates that the USA is also able to chase cybercriminals operating in other countries.

Timo Soini's blog raises questions: "After, the flood"
On Thursday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini published a blog text that raises questions.
"During my reign, the party grew from nothing to a Government party with 37 members of parliament.
Soini's text includes references to the 18th century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the flood metaphor.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
This year's elections mark the first time power is handed peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.

Flood of certain types of tourists threatens local culture
It is difficult to move around in narrow streets and beautiful squares are packed with tourists, leaving no room for those who live in Venice.
They are forced to move farther away from the historic centre, while homes have been replaced by hotels.

I get along fine without such attention
Amalie Iuel has published spectacular photos of herself in such places as the Grand Canyon.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a highly popular athlete in her current home country Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in 400 metres by crossing the line at 51.81.
A frequent user of social media, Iuel noticed, soon after breaking the records, that there are downsides to being famous and in the public eye.
Iuel was forced to make her Snapchat account private.
In her interview for VG, Iuel did not want to go into details regarding the photos she has received.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish and his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when she was two years old.
When Amalie was 12, the family first moved to Namibia and then to Pakistan because of her father's work.
These were followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
In Norway, Iuel trains under three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
"In the USA, coaches do not ask anything, they simply tell us what to do.
In Norway, coaches have much more time to interact personally with athletes", Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel is the holder of Norwegian records in 400 metres and in 400 metres hurdles.
Foot injury threatened the whole career of snowboarder Janne Korpi – now ready to race in the World Championships: "It's nice when nothing hurts"
Janne Korpi, 31, one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has once again been able to enjoy the sport he loves.
Last summer, his whole career was at risk.
I thought that, damn, this sure is fun, let's continue for a couple of seasons."
Today, Korpi will be racing in the halfpipe event of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-athlete Team Finland competing in Sierra Nevada.
The youngest members of the team, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpi.
I remember when I was that young that everything was new and I was insanely excited about everything.
This also gives me energy", Korpi says.
Alongside his snowboarding career, Janne Korpi has also been building another career in sports.
The son of legendary harness racer Pekka Korpi is a fan of harness racing: he has his own racehorses that he prepares training plans for.
According to Korpi, harness racing and coaching offer a potential career plan when his snowboarding career eventually ends.
It feels like I'm studying it alongside snowboarding.
The Elitloppet cruise hosted together with Jaajo Linnonmaa is also part of harness racing.
The two have leased a cruise ship for the Elitloppet event in Stockholm at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to bring the age-old tradition back to life.
Now we are at the point where at least we cannot go bankrupt.

Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.

NYT: Calls praised by Trump were phony – White House press secretary: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The calls with the President of Mexico and the leader of the Boy Scouts praised by Trump turned out to be fabrications.
However, she said that Trump did not lie.
According to Sanders, many leaders of the Boy Scouts talked with Trump in person, and Trump had a conversation with Enrique Peña Nieto, the President of Mexico, at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
Speech to Boy Scouts raised criticism
On Tuesday, Politico published a full version of Trump's interview with the Wall Street Journal
"I got a call from the leader of Boy Scouts who said that it was the best speech that was ever made to them,
