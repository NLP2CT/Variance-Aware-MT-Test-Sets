Breaking news: Our Cosmic Visitor Huge Asteroid 2014 JO25
The most important cause of this are developments in observational techniques and tools.
For example, last January a bus-sized asteroid passed by within half the distance between the Earth and the Moon (~250,000 km).
And more importantly, the asteroid could be identified only a couple days before it passed by.
If an asteroid having a diameter of 100 meters collided with Earth at an angle of 45 degrees and at a speed of 60 km/s, it would form a crater 250 meters deep and 1200 meters in diameter.
The collision would be the equivalent to an earthquake at six on the Richter scale and, even if you were 10 km away from the impact point, you would have third-degree burns on your body.
If such an asteroid collided the with the Earth with the same angle and speed, it would form a crater 600 meters deep and 12 km in diameter.
That is an entire neighborhood turning into a crater and disappearing all at once.
The impact would be equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude of 8 on the Richter scale.
If an asteroid of the size that would have destroyed the dinosaurs was on a collision course with the Earth, the safest option would be to leave the planet.
Tons of objects from space are falling to earth.
As creatures with an average lifetime of 70 years, I’m sure you are somewhat relieved.
Planning to reinforce their defense, Beşiktaş has in its sights Gary Medel who, most likely, is to part ways with Inter...
It was reported that Beşiktaş made an offer to both sides and that the Chilean football player was considering living in Istanbul with his family.
However, in opposition to Gazetta’s claim, it looks difficult for Beşiktaş which is under FFP limitations to pay 10 million Euro to Medel.
Beşiktaş informed Borsa Istanbul on Negredo’s transfer
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.
Demba Ba is OK at Besiktas
Transferred to China’s Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million Euro two seasons ago, and then rented to Beşiktaş in the season’s break, Demba Ba now returns to Beşiktaş free of charge.
Requesting a comprehensive health report from the Senegalese player, the Black Eagles started moving after the star football player sent his report.
He was not included in the list
The Senegalese player is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days and sign an official contract.
Castillo has undergone surgery in Trabzonspor
In a statement on Trabzonspor’s website, it is written that Castillo has undergone arthroscopic meniscus surgery and "In the aftermath of the surgery, performed by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar, our player is expected to rejoin the team for training within four weeks".
He argued "It does not want us to progress".
Reacting to the fact that the Iraqi central government gave no weapons at all for them to fight against the DAESH terrorist group, but rather that all of the weapons were supplied to Hashd Al-Shaabi, which was established quickly following a fatwa, Barzani added
However, while Hashd Al-Shaabi has no existence in the constitution, by violating the law all means were made available to them.
We are not saying that we are against Hashd Al-Shaabi.
Peshmerga and Hashd Al-Shaabi have fought on the same front, but then why is Hashd Al-Shaabi being legalized, yet Peshmerga’s existence and fight against terrorism is being covered up.
Disaster was avoided by 10 minutes
According to a news article published by the BBC, while the North Korean missile was airborne, a Boeing 777 type airliner belonging to Air France was flying over the west of Hokkaido, located to the north of Japan.
An official said that the missile fell on the spot where the airliner had passed only ten minutes earlier and was estimated to have been within 100–150 kilometers of the airliner.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
But he did not silence his critics.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
And true leadership means accepting that.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
I have found the answer
Its personnel count is 117,378.
Yes, it is the President of Religious Affairs Directorate Görmez that I will be talking about!
For days... I have been looking for an answer to the question in my head...
I am curious about the real reason for the unseating of Mehmet Görmez...
Nothing.
I cannot find the answer I am searching for to the question.
Just at the beginning of this year...
Mehmet Görmez prepared the Religious Affairs Directorate’s 2017-2021 Strategic Plan.
So, what happened?
You can very well say "He has been in the office for seven years, isn’t that enough".
First the President of the DİB, M. Rıfat Börekçi, served for seventeen years.
So... The duration of a president’s term is obvious.
I am getting back to my question: Why did Mehmet Görmez leave his position?
His closeness to Shia
The decoding of this sentence is this: He did not look out for the Sunnis!
What did reformer mean?
The answer of this question was hidden in one of Mehmet Görmez’s overseas trips.
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to participate in the Twenty-ninth Unity Conference in Tehran, aimed at rapprochement amongst the Islamic schools of thought.
He met with Iran’s religious leader Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
He lined up to pray with Shia clergy.
In situations where school of thoughts precede the religion, the religion itself was the most damaged...
Shia and Sunnis are one single Islamic Community, Ummah...
One year later...
The Thirtieth Unity Meeting was attended by Selahattin Özgündüz, representing Turkey.
So...
This is not the Sunni idea, it’s Wahabism
Mehmet Görmez’s trip to Iran and the speech he gave made him the target of the "traditional scholars".
The reason was obvious; "traditional scholars" in the DİB who are anti-Shia/anti-Iran.
The main person responsible for this was the Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş who was in charge of the DİB!
Mehmet Görmez was so suffocated that Görmez demanded that the DİB be subordinated under the Presidency.
At the core of it...
Within the state, There are difference about Sunnism.
"Traditional scholars" whose theoretical worlds were shaped in the madrasahs of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, were unifying Sunni thought with Wahabism-Salafism under the shadow of the USA!
Cübbeli Ahmet’s words for Mehmet Görmez were not surprising: "The Diyanet has never had one more dangerous."
"O My Lord, bestow upon us a president who is loyal to our homeland, to our people and loyal to the orthodox followers of the sunna"...
- Resisting bringing Sunni thought up to the Saudi Wahabi-Salafi line...
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu went to China on an official visit.
Çavuşoğlu and the Chinese Foreign Minister, Vang Yi, organized a joint press-conference at the Official State Residence in the capital city, Beijing.
Vang said "We hope that Turkey participates more in international issues."
On the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Çavuşoğlu said "Turkey is searching for cooperation with regional and international organizations; international organizations are not alternatives for one another, but rather they complement each other".
Ruhani officially starts his second term
In May, having won Iran’s presidential election, Hasan Ruhani’s presidency was approved by the country’s leader, Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
Elected president of Iran for the second time, Hasan Ruhani’s swearing in ceremony was attended by the country’s religious leader Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
Taking office for four more years as president, Ruhani`s position will become official after being sworn in during the oath taking ceremony on Saturday, August 5.
Representing Turkey, the Minister of Economy, Nihat Zeybekçi is expected to participate in the ceremony.
Security measures at the Cilvegözü Border Gate
Trucks carrying loads other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine or cleaning materials will not be allowed to pass through the Cilve Gözü Border Gate in the Reyhanlı District of Hatay Province.
However, aid trucks remain allowed to pass through the Cilve Gözü Border Gate.
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
Polygamy is common here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
There is no public transport.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
"I'm tired."
"I'm afraid," he says.
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Poverty feeds the discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.

Good news about social aid for over 4,000 chronic patients
Based on studies undertaken, in the new social aid programme’s first stage, regular psycho-social and monetary support will be supplied to poor citizens who are fighting against Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) disease caused by tuberculosis and the measles microbe.
In the programme’s later phases, poor citizens fighting against other rare and risky diseases will also be included in the social aid programme.
In addition to the planned provide support at a level of two-thirds of the minimum wage, further payments will be made to tuberculosis patients who are identified by the health unit as being unable to fulfill their medical self-care, who are bedridden, or whose houses or living conditions need to be improved.
Other than that, citizens with SSPE disease should obtain a medical board report prepared according to the procedures and principles specified in "Directives on Disability Criteria, Classification and Medical Board Reports for the Disabled."
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
China finds US explanations to be positive
Drawing attention to the fact that the security of the Korean Peninsula was their priority, Vang stressed that they expected that through mutual dialogue the sides would find common ground for a solution to their concerns, that the Beijing Administration was insistent on non-proliferation in the Peninsula, the preservation of peace and stability, and the resolution of problems through dialogue and discussion.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.

Single digit inflation
According to data released yesterday by the Turkey Statistics Institution (TUIK), while the Consumer Price Index (TUFE) rose by 0.15% in July, the 9.79 annual inflation from January till today, inflation has fallen to single digits for the first time.
Against decreases in headline inflation, we experienced an increase in core inflation indicators.
Indicating that the inflation rate could end the year at 9.3%, Kapital FX Research’s Deputy Director, Enver Erkan, said "Inflation may fluctuate until December and then drop to a single digit in December."
We will finalize the reforms in the coming Food Committee.
In the fight against inflation, the volatility of food prices should be decreased and supply must be increased.
We found balance in the second half.
We got a chance for the second goal.

Fernando is in Istanbul
Stating that there was a high degree of interest in the Raqqa Internal Security Force, the coalition forces would continue to screen all applicants who applied for training and employment.
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Patient’s relatives broke the doctor’s nose
The head of the hospital’s Child Cardiology Clinic, Prof. Dr. Feyza Aysenur Pac, said "A slogan like ‘No to violence in health’ is insufficient; in fact, it’s like taking sides."
Condemning the incident, Mr Pac said:
Stressing the importance society’s awareness of the issue of violence in health, Mr Odabas said "Unfortunately, this has become a vocational complication that we go through from time to time."
"We will take our own measures, but the most important is for our fellow citizens to protect their health workers.
Saying that legal procedures have been initiated, Turkmen added "Our laws dealing with violence in health are being applied adequately."
"And, there have been examples of heavy penalties applied" he said.
According to the reports, the incident took place at 17:45 the day before yesterday.
Dr Ozbek’s nose was broken in the incident, and his assailants were detained.
One of the doctor witnesses said:
Our friend’s nose was broken and he was covered in blood.
For 15–20 minutes security set up a blockade between us.
During the operation in which six people were detained, a search of a warehouse, residential and business premises as well as body searches of the suspects led to the seizure of 10 long barreled weapons with 35 magazines, 2,370 loaded cartridges, 3 guns with 7 magazines, 382 loaded cartridges, two hunting rifles and one scimitar, 39,705 TL and 15,870 USD in cash, debentures in various people’s names with a total value of 163,000 TL, checks to a total of 40,500 TL, two blank check stubs and several digital materials
YPG looting in Syria...
US intervened
Upon this development, the US forces in the region entered the town with armored vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type armored vehicles, personnel carriers and Husky type mine detection vehicle were used to create buffer zone in the town.
A local activist network reported that "Raqqa is being silently murdered" and announced yesterday that 121 civilians had been killed by artillery fire in July alone.
A delayed perception of either domestic or international realities can drag not only people but also countries into crisis.
Don Quixote, the Oblomov Realities, and the perception of reality or just not perceiving it at all have comprised much of the world of literature’s subject matter.
Cervantes’ ‘Don Quixote’ is a deranged person who thought he is a chivalrous knight in times when the bourgeoisie have started to form.
Others, when it comes to perceiving domestic and worldwide realities and changes, act as quickly as the thought centers of the developed countries.
Madrasah and university, Janissary and the modern army, the encounters of belief with doubt were responsible for a dramatic-content dualism.
Later, yesterday’s progressives would start to describe the new and progressive as ‘Dangerous’, and those who wanted to interpret domestic and global realities as appropriate for an updated reality as a ‘Traitor’.
Historical artifact operation in Muş Province
In a statement made by the Governor’s Office, it was reported that the Provincial Gendarme Command teams had conducted an operation into historical artifact smuggling.
In the statement it was said that "As a result of the work carried out, two gold coins, one silver coin, twenty bronze coins, one golden bracelet, two bronze rings, one shattered glass bracelet, four stone objects, eight necklaces, one pink-white colored stone object, one picture frame, twenty-three stone objects of various diameters/sizes/colors, four sharp metal objects, six Arabic books – assumed to be Holy Koran – from some old period in various sizes with worn covers and pages and with some torn pages, one earthenware cover, ten broken stone objects of some old period in various diameters and sizes, and one bronze copper vessel – along with two suspects – were captured."
Turkey wind
Aiming to reduce Turkey’s energy costs, the tender also paved the way for an investment of one billion USD and around 4,000 jobs.
Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the underbidding.
Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon Energy consortium took no recesses.
The Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Berat Albayrak, commented: This is a record-breaking day for Turkey.
The record had been held by Mexico with 3.84 USD cents per kilowatt-hour.
"For all of Turkey, 80 million are proud of what we see here, and the biggest share belongs to our President who with his 15-year rule and leadership has brought Turkey to this point.
Turbines will be built in five designated regions.
An annual budget of five million USD has been allocated for R&D work which will employ fifty technical staff, 80% of whom should be local engineers.
The project’s licence’s duration is thirty years.
Türker emphasised that this tender reflected confidence in the Turkish economy.
Kalyon Holding Energy Group’s chairman, Murtaza Ata, said "This has become the tender that will reduce foreign dependency by 1,000 megawatts."
The electricity generated will meet the needs of around 1.1 million households. Each year, the three billion kWh of electricity energy generated will, on average, deliver a reduction of 1.5 million tonnes in CO2 emissions.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"Get him out of the car!"
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
Did I go too hard?
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
The scene begins again.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
According to reports, near Salkim on the Kavaklidere-Yatagan highway, a car bearing the registration plate 48 YS 411 and driven by Adem Saglam collided with another having plate 09 B 1510 and driven by Sinan Kiroglan.
Duraniye Kiroglan, eight-month pregnant Derya Kiroglan, and Yasemin Kiroglan died at the scene. Mertcan Kiroglan died at Yatagan State Hospital where he was hospitalized.
The injured: Sinan, Senem, Furkan Kiroglan and Adem, Yilmaz and Abdullah Yigit Saglam were cared for at the Mugla Sitki Kocman University Education and Research Hospital, and at the Yucelen Hospital.
The Yatagan-Kavaklidere highway was closed to traffic for sometime because of the accident.

The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
According to the initial report of the Forensic Medical Institution, the initial findings of Hakan’s preliminary autopsy indicate that the cause death was suicide.
His family identified the gauze bandage as an elastic bandage used for injuries.
It was reported that the Police would appeal to Hakan’s friends to testify.
The Police are considering that Hakan’s suicide could have been caused by a gang.
After it was confirmed that Hakan committed suicide, eyes turned to the disturbing "Metin2".
While doing this, many battles occur and the level of violence increases.
To become stronger, players buy characters.
That’s how my son was found.
We were aware that he played such a game.
Let’s say he’d get a little bored and just leave the game.
However his mother, Gulizar Ekinci, said "There was no one entering or leaving the building".
Apparently my son entered the house at a particular hour.
When his older brother came in there was only one chair.
"But when his body was found, next to the computer there were two chairs" she said.
Or he might have invited someone involved with the game over to the house and some problem might have arisen.
Possibly the child perceived its images and constructs as real.
It’s possible that the trauma that caused his suicide might have been related to blackmail.
He could not have committed suicide only because of the game itself.
He could have been involved with a gang.
This couldn’t be something that the child would have done on his own.
The important thing here is for parents to pay attention to what their children play and, if it is online, how they talk with other players.
Closing the month of July with a 7.06% increase, the BIST 100 Index was followed by the Dow Jones of the US with 2.54%, and the FTSE 100 Index of UK on 0.81%.
In a statement made to an AA reporter, Mekra Investment Research’s Director, Eren Can Ümüt, confirmed that the BIST 100 Index had continued its increase for eight months and that the increase had exceeded 37% since the beginning of the year.
Funds, especially those looking for high returns, prefer countries yielding high interest rates.
Underlining that FED’s three interest rate increase forecasts at the beginning of the year had stressed the markets, but that the FED removed this uncertainty by using its verbal direction policy, Ümüt said that there was a market insensitivity to the FED’s interest increase.
Ümüt was recorded as saying that they had not seen a strong recovery on the domestically sourced newsfeed, and that the current outlook could be interpreted as more like triggering domestic markets to try to close the differences resulting from the increased risk appetite in the international arena.
Discussing how technically testing new record levels at 108,600, the BIST 100 Index recorded small profit growth, Ümüt commented
Especially the 109,500–110,000 region is a critical threshold in the short term.
After approaching these levels, it is normal to realize profit sales.
In the short term, we think that, regarding pricing over 110,000, we should form a new narrative domestically or intentionally.
In such case, even if we support 107,000, I think we could see some easing down to the 106,000–105,500 region.
Pointing to the fact that both the FED’s and the European Central Bank’s (ECB) decisions would be the focal point of the global market, Ümüt said that the expectations on FED were already known, but that although no interest rate increase is expected in the September FOMC, the possibility of a balance sheet reduction being enacted might trigger a strengthening of the US dollar.
"Hence, some negative prices pressures could break out in countries with high current account deficits and limited access to foreign funds, like Turkey" he commented.
Gedik Yatırım Investment Consultancy’s Director, Erol Gürcan, said that in the aftermath of Trump’s election in US in November 2016, there was a serious rally in the global share markets.
Stating that it would be possible to say that this rally was triggered, in essence, by Trump’s initial promises of tax reductions and by developments that could increase global growth expectations, Gürcan said:
Stressing that central banks of important countries, like the FED, the ECB and the Bank of England, having decided to slowly tighten their stand on their current expansionary monetary policies would again be among developing countries’ critical risk factors, Gürcan said "Having continued its modest interest rate rise, the possibility of the Fed starting a balance sheet reduction process after September, the possibility of one of the developed countries’ central banks–the ECB–terminating its asset buying program in the near term, and the possibility of the BOE increasing interests rates after the Fed does the same are each primary developments to be monitored"
Saying that, in regards to potential adjustment movements in the index over the upcoming period, the supported region of 104,150--104,600 corresponding to the increasing trend from the beginning of the year, and a 200-hour moving average, were both very critical, Gürcan stated that, if this support region is broken out of, the adjustment movement could continue to the levels of 101,700, to 100,000, and to 99,200 in turn.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.
But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.

Qatar: With the help of Turkey, we circumvented the embargo within hours
Al Thani said "I would like to thank you very much for your honorable attitude and the support you have provided us."
I would like to convey the greetings of Qatar’s Emir to my brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Qatari economy proved its resistance.
We have to work with all of our power for Qatar’s independence and strength.
With the help of Turkey, within hours we had mostly circumvented the embargo.
Currently we are lacking nothing.
Our natural resources, our natural gas exports greatly support Qatar’s economy.
Recent decisions had significant a role in this.
As a result of Turkish products proving themselves in the Qatari market, it is very important to expedite the entry of Turkish products from every sector, and for their investments in many areas.
Cost of recent natural disasters is 300 million TL
TSB Chairman Can Akin Çağlar said that claim notices totaling 116,007,000 TL had been submitted to insurance companies in the aftermath of the July 18 floods, that claim notices totaling 12 million TL for 800 claims were submitted to insurance companies following the July 21 earthquake in Gokova, and that claim notices totaling 168 million TL for 22,000 claims were submitted to insurance companies after the July 27 floods and hail storm in Istanbul. He added that the cost to insurance of those last three incidents came to 300 million TL.
Stressing the sector’s efforts to compensate for the economic loss, Çağlar said that three our of every four people did not have home insurance, one out of every two businesses did not have fire insurance, and that two out of three people did not have comprehensive insurance coverage. He added that "because of climate change, the risk of natural disasters is increasing."
"Comprehensive insurance general conditions state that the insured should report their damages within 5 working days and this duration expired yesterday." said Mr Çağlar.
"Besides, these are natural disasters, therefore there is no need for the insured to worry because no company can say ‘we are not paying for that" he said.
Ina period of problems in the Turkey – Germany relationship, that a German firm, Siemens, won Turkey’s first Wind Energy Renewable Resource Fields (YEKA) drew attention.
The German media announced the development as "German Siemens won a giant tender in Turkey".
"Opened to create a 1,000 Megawatt wind energy capacity, the Wind Energy Renewable Resource Fields (YEKA) tender is first of its kind" it wrote, reporting that the number of firms competing in the tender dropped from eight to down to two, with the Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortia competing, with the Chinese Mingyang consortium withdrawing from the tender in the thirtieth round.
In a statement after the tender, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Berat Albayrak, said some striking things about Turkey-Germany relations.
When we look at it from 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this result will make an important contribution to Turkey-Germany relations.
Best of luck to you."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.
"This is the fight to be made.
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
It will be a great fight."
Turkish rebuff from Russia to the US
The reason is the cost of borrowing.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."
Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque will open to prayers today
Sarı supplied the following information: "The restoration works was undertaken in two parts."
The first part was the repairing of the mosque, the main building.
First of all, the wooden dome’s lead sheets were opened, and after their renewal, the external walls were cleared of dirt and corrosion.
As seen upon entering, the mosque is very richly embellished.
It has a mixed style.
ABDÜLHAMİT’S LABOUR IS IN IT
"The chandelier in the middle of mosque is a gift from the Second German Empire."
It had minor faults, was renewed, cleaned and re-hung it in its place.
We know that these were personally made by our great leader Abdülhamit Han.
They are still standing in their original form.
Sarı said that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was expected to participate in the inauguration.
Pantic claims in Goztepe
The Ukraine press have written about the possibility that the twenty-five year old Serbian player, who was left out of the roster at Dinoma Kiev, might be rented to the Goztepe club.
Starting his career at his home country’s Red Star team in Serbia, Pantic has played for many teams including Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
In last season’s mid-season break, Pantic signed a contract with Dinamo Kiev.
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
The rally erupted in cheers.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Some say you chose Turkey for money.
What do you say?
My entry into the national team is because of Fenerbahçe.
With Turkey I opened a new page.
You recently cried in a press conference.
Can you tell us why?
I felt similar feelings when the National Anthem was played after I won the gold medal in the European Championships in Amsterdam.
I could not hold back my tears.
You are with someone at the moment and you went to Cuba together.
Would you like to share your experiences?
The most important positive side of being with a Turk is calmness...
Peace, when I compared to Cuban women...
Your girlfriend is at the same time your assistant coach.
She eats more sweets than I do.
(Both laugh) Actually, I do not have a very strict diet, but she intervenes from time to time into what I eat.
How are you with Turkish cuisine? Does your girlfriend cook for you?
Turkish women cook well, but my girlfriend cooks better.
(Laughs) Beans and rice are my first choice.

TYDTA Chairman Ermut: Foreign direct investment will exceed last year’s.
TYDTA Chairman, Arda Ermut, has indicated that 55% of all investment last year came after July.
Relaying that there had been no decrease in investment following the July 15 FETÖ coup attempt and that, on the contrary, there had been an increase, Ermut said "Perhaps, it would have been more, but it was inhibited."
But this is not enough.
Still, Asia’s share went up from 2% to 7–8%.
Turkey has relations with all of them; Saudi Arabia and Qatar especially are two important actors.
For us, they are no different than Turkish companies.
"We definitely won’t let them suffer" said Ermut, adding that they continued to support all investors with confidence.
"In the relations with Germany, there isn’t one single investor saying ‘We had experienced some problems and are running away’." said Ermut, adding that there had been potential, entering and other companies that they had been monitoring.
Stressing that all state institutions should be careful during a time in which there are perception management operations being undertaken against Turkey, Ermut said that the issue was serious and that it could be affected by the tiniest communication.
Commenting on the events of the past 2–3 weeks, that there was a good lesson to be learned, Ermut said
Unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany is increasing such rhetoric.
Pointing out the fact that a significant proportion of the investments that were withdrawn would continue to be in the real estate sector, Ermut shared information detailing that new investments could be witnessed in logistics, health, fintech, information technology, petrochemicals, food, energy and manufacturing.
Underlining the new investments that they would be announcing in the coming months, he said "In the near future, we might have an announcement to make in the manufacturing field."

Bags of TAPDK label hoods collected from used bottles were recorded by the police.
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.
Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Gunes Sigorta are trading on Borsa Istanbul.
Confirming that 2015’s figures will also be met this year, and stressing the losses incurred in 2012 and 2015 would diminish other branches’ profits, Çağlar said "This means that by financing bad drivers we are increasing the price of home insurance policies for other citizens."
Çağlar continued, saying
"However, the Treasury looks at the overall situation, and the Treasury will have the last word as to when this will happen".
On the other hand, as of July, a compulsory traffic insurance "Risky Insured Pool" began being implemented for the levels or vehicle groups having a high damage frequency.
The premium for those insured will be set by the Treasury Undersecretariat.
Çağlar said that with the premium cap implementation, the generation of premiums during the first six months of 2017 was down by 11.5% compared to the same period of the previous year, there were 8.6 million policies which was an increase of 4.9%, and taking into consideration inflation, the discount in the vehicular policies was up to 30%.
Noting that this year the traffic arm would take off the profits of the industry’s other arms, Çağlar said "With these capped prices, this loss is not sustainable.
How much longer could the sector bear this loss?" bear this loss?"
On the question of whether foreigners would reduce their proportional weight in the Turkish insurance sector, Çağlar said "They are not there, yet."
"Therefore, Turkey is a place where there should be growth" he. He continued:
Çağlar forecasted that the sector would be finishing the year with an increase of 15% in total premiums generated.
Good news regarding social aid for thousands of chronic patients

One out of ten investing firms remain German
Ermut expressed his thought that "In our current state of relations with Germany, there isn’t one single investor saying ‘We have experienced some problems and are running away’".
Some of them already have investments in Turkey.
Ozer on the way to be the Last Ottoman
It has been reported that the experienced player, whom the club’s administration gave two weeks to find a club, has reached an agreement with Osmanlıspor and will sign an official contract in the next few days.
The transfer of the century is done!
Barcelona announced that Neymar has been transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for 222 million Euro.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), from France’s First Football League (League 1), announced that it had signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star player Neymar.
In the announcement made on the club’s website, with a transfer fee of 222 million Euro making him the world’s most expensive football player, it was reported that the twenty-five year old Neymar had signed a contract that would bind him to PSG until June 30, 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said that he was very happy to wear the French team’s uniform and added "Since I started my football career in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most challenging and ambitious teams."
The reason for me joining my friends by coming to this club is to get several cups, as our fans wish" he said.

Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
So, in my opinion, the "pioneering movement" that needs to be considered is the Qadıyanis.
In 1891, Gulam Ahmed went further and said that, according to divine revelations and inspirations, that Jesus, Son of Mariam, had died a natural death like other prophets and that Allah had sent him, Gulam Ahmed, as messiah and mahdi, the long-expected of the Christians and the Muslims.
According to this, the messiah and mahdi expected by the Muslims are the one and the same person, and that this was Mirza Gulam Ahmed Qadiyani.
(Encyclopedia of Islam, TDV)
If we consider that the "First Muslim Scientist’ given the Nobel Prize was Prof. Abdusselam, that Sir Zaferullah Han was President of the United Nations Court of Justice, that the "First Oscar-Winning Muslim Actor" was Mahershala Ali and that these were all Qadiyanis, then we can see more vividly the depth of the global powers’.
In summary, it is possible to trace back the motivations of structures such as FETÖ or Tahirul Qadri to the Qadiyanis, to the point of origin, and that all of these organizations support them for spoiling societies so that they can approve imperialism and serve colonialism.
Her "last wish" came out of cargo parcel
Still running the same restaurant for 47 years, Tommy Fello put the drink in dry ice, paid $123 USD (435 TL) and had it delivered to the hospital 600 kilometers away as "urgent delivery" cargo.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul

Barış Yarkadaş said that 6,760 people worked for the TRT, many programs were outsourced, and absurd prices were paid.
The resources that the TRT had transferred to partisan production companies were revealed in official documents that had come to hand.
The official response to the CHP’s Istanbul MP Barış Yarkadaş’s petition, lodged under the Right to Information Act, showed how the TRT’s resources are spent.
The CHP’s MP described it, saying "This means looting".
Barış Yarkadaş said "Production companies of pro-AKP journalists and businessmen are, in a sense, looting the TRT."
Reiterating that the funds transferred to the companies are taxes collected from the people, Yarkadaş added "An institution with 7,000 personnel has became a cash cow for the AKP."
Yarkadaş added "Being the mouth piece of the AKP, the TRT is unable to obtain commercials because it is not being watched."
"And the people are shouldering the load" he said.
CHP’s Yarkadaş continued "The TRT is paying 660,000,000 TL in annual salary for its personnel, but all of its work is outsourced."
This is an utter disgrace.
He abandoned suicide and, kneeling before his wife, apologized to her.

What time is Friday Prayer?
Do not hesitate to repent. No sin is greater than ALLAH’s Mercy.
Have a Blessed Friday.
Never refuse one who asks from You.
O whose name is Remedy, of whose invocation is cure and whose obedience is richness; may you be the moral and material cure for these, your servants, whose essences are hope and whose weapons are prayer.
May the intercession of the rose-faced Prophet (p.b.u.h) be upon those who greet his ummah with Allah’s heavenly light.
Prayer is love, Prayer is Serenity, Prayer is Hope.
Happy, Serene, Hopeful, Love-Filled, Blessed, Friday...
May Our Lord make You from those who pray, those who are ever-grateful, those who know how to love, and from those who wander in Paradise, O My Lord!
May all goodness enlighten you, may the smile be always in your face and in your heart.
I wish you a Happy Friday.
O Lord, make us friends with your friends, enemies with your enemies, make us from those who are patient and grateful!
O My Lord, make us from those who persevere in their works, grateful to your blessings, perform their prayers properly and speak the truth.
I wish you a Happy Friday.
May you have a blessed Friday
Pray in such a way that your sin should cry out the greatness of your repentance...
Seek refuge from Satan in your Creator, so that you kill your ego, and not that your ego kills you
O My Lord, I seek refuge in you from the knowledge that would benefit, from the heart that would not fear, from the prayer that would not be heard, from the ego that would never satisfy, from the terrible companion that is hunger, from the terrible confidant that is treachery, from laziness, from cowardliness, from growing old, from being an infidel at the last breath, from the cabal of Anti-Christ, from the torment of the grave and from the cabal of the death.
Friday Prayer will be performed at 13:02 in Ankara, and at 13:17 in Istanbul.

The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'

Two mysterious deaths
Salihoğlu was alleged to have hung herself.
An investigation was launched into the two consecutive mysterious deaths, both of which are considered by the police to have been suicides.
‘SHE LOOKED DEPRESSED’
The medical team confirmed that Çilingiroğlu had lost her life after having fallen from the nineteenth floor onto the hard surface.
Giving testimony to the police, her mother Mediha Çilingiroğlu said that "She had looked depressed recently."
After Çilingiroğlu’s body is sent to the Forensic Medical Institution, she is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It is still being investigated whether Çilingiroğlu has been pushed or whether she committed suicide.
THE ‘KILLED HERSELF’ ALLLEGATION
The other suspicious death was in Sarıyer’s Zekeriyaköy.
Studying at Koç University, a student Melis Salihoğlu (24) was found dead in her house.
Very much liked by her family, her relatives and friends, it is alleged that Melis ended her life by hanging herself.
Melis Salihoğlu’s death caused deep grief in her family and amongst her relatives.
Green grass under our feet, your best friend Jack and your sister Eyşan running after that small ball, we were in good spirits.
She shared the message "Why was your death was required?"
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
That was my requirement," she says.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."

Jeremain Lens to Beşiktaş with a transfer fee
At the end of one and a half months of meetings, initially taken on loan, Lens was bought by Beşiktaş with a transfer fee.
After more intense meetings over the last week, Lens agreed with Beşiktaş for a transfer fee of five million Euro.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official statement on the Jeremain Lens transfer.
Seven years later the couple decided to get divorced.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Others have tried and failed.
If so, he will be the first.
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Okay.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
How'd that work out?
İzmir’s Public Prosecutor, Berkant Karakaya, has completed his investigation into the leaking of information on improprieties in a ‘military espionage investigation’, which had been initiated based on the statements of the secret witness code-named ‘Sarmaşık’ and that identified the Turkish Naval Forces’ Command in Chief for Personnel Rear Admiral Cihat Yaycı as a FETÖ terrorist."
In the investigation, it was stressed that Rear Admiral Yaycı was not a member of the terrorist organization. On the contrary, he had helped the investigation team expose crypto members of the terrorist group who had infiltrated the Turkish Naval Forces Command, and he was active in the fight against FETÖ.
It was emphasized in the decision that an attempt to pacify Yaycı was made by putting him under the Turkish Naval Forces Command, as per the martial law orders issued during the coup attempt on July 15th, and that Yaycı was actively fighting FETÖ from day one.
In Karakaya decision to decline the suit, he wrote "It is understood that with the help of a custom template, 64 fundamental criteria and 209 sub criteria, Yaycı was working on identifying the crypto FETÖ members within the confidential services of the Turkish Naval Forces Command."
Rear Admiral Yaycı had previously stood trial accused of libel.
It was later uncovered that FETÖ was behind it and the alleged crime was their plot.
former General Staff Legal Counselor, Colonel Muharremm Köse, for permitting the investigation, General Staff Intelligence Chief Lieutenant, General Mustafa Özsoy, for being part of the investigation committee, the former Judge Lietuenant Commander Erkan Ağın, former Lieutenant Necmetting Aksoy for permitting the prosecution, the former Judge, Lieutenant Akif Us, and the former Judge, Lieutenant Junior Grade Serdar Çamiçi for judging the case, and former Staff Colonel Mustafa Çiçek for bearing witness against Yaycı.
Some of the organization’s members, including FETÖ fugitive Tuncay Opçin, had targeted Yaycı with material they had shared on social media before and after July 15.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.
This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'
Last day’s rush!
The driver Erbil Kilic "We rushed here."
Issuing an earthquake warning against the huge buildings rising along the seaside, the CHP Councilor, Nadir Ataman, said "The expert report in the court case specifically underlines that these buildings would not survive a 6-level earthquake."
The CHP’s Bakırköy Municipality Councilor, Nadir Ataman, reacted to the huge shopping mall, hotel and residence projects rising one after another in the district.
Drawing attention to the buildings along the sea side, blocking the wind, Ataman said "Those who eighty years ago planned according to the wind created the Atatürk Forest in Florya.
"The district cannot breathe" he said.
Explaining that the buildings rising like a wall along the Ataköy sea side had changed the climatic balance, Ataman continued: "Because of the skyscrapers, the temperature is felt as if it was 10 degrees higher."
But, instead, our skyscrapers are rising along Istanbul’s wind corridors.
Ataman said that the skyscrapers are harming the environment as well as people’s health. The skyscrapers are blocking the connection to the sea for the people of Bakırköy, and that they would apply to the Council of Monuments as well as appealing the decision in the judiciary.
Non-surgical treatment is possible in pilonidal sinus.
In the cases where phenol is used, the success is 83%.
In this method, diseased tissue is cleaned efficiently and the tissue space is used to kill hairs.
Another non-surgical pilonidal sinus treatment is a laser-based method.
With two non-surgical options for pilonidal sinus, patients are able to return their normal social and work life in short period of time.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
Last minute fist!
Relaying the day’s developments in a live broadcast, the correspondent warned the man who was shouting "We will invade Ukraine" saying "Please keep quiet".
Reported to be a former paratrooper, the drunken man punched the correspondent with a hard fist.
Millions of people watched the moment in shock.
The Economy Coordination Board (EKK) meeting was held under the chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, who is in charge of the economy.
Turkey’s macroeconomic outlook was to be discussed during the meeting.
Get rid of a herniated disc in 45 minutes
Underlining the fact that, especially in those groups of patient in which pains continue, invasive methods (such as epidural injections, radio frequency techniques, in-disc invasive methods) would be utilized, Oguz Karaeminogullari reiterated that "If there is no success with any of these methods, and if numbness in the legs and weakness is becoming more obvious, then surgery will become necessary".
Most of the time, microscopic surgery is defined as ‘closed surgery’, but microscopic surgery has same approach as open surgery.
In fully closed herniated disc surgery, however, those risks are absent because the surrounding tissues are protected.
Full closed herniated disc surgery takes only 45 minutes.
The special commission at work
The Commission will follow the hearings into Berberoglu
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
A striking growth estimate from Mehmet Simsek
In his statement, Simsek stated that inflation in Turkey should come down to single digits and that food inflation constituted a "risk area".
Deputy Prime Minister forecast that the inflation would sink beneath 7% during 2018.
In his speech, Simsek said
The coming twelve months will be critical for reducing uncertainties.
There is a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
My hope is that the uncertainties in our immediate neighborhood will also decrease.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with a couple of reforms, I believe we can fix Turkey to a growth rate of 5%.
Therefore, the coming twelve months will be critical.
Whether we wanted it or not, many of our classical markets have collapsed.
If I said that our pension companies do not strive enough, I believe that it would be reasonable.
Why?
To begin with, there will be a performance increase, in addition to the 25% that the state is giving.
We restructured BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants and an accumulation of 70 billion Turkish Lira.
You have to hand it to them, the system has been successful.
They should place some advertisements, explain the system.
We are working on the right to opt out.
We will look into it, we are working on it.
Maybe citizens will see the returns, see the accumulations and remain in the system.
What would you do?
For one thing, the system is functional.
Sometimes insurance companies explain things from one side only.
They increased the premiums very quickly.
We have issued new, clear regulations.
We have a difference of opinion here.
Let me tell you this and repeat it.
That is to say, I do not find the price cap implementations correct: they were forced on us.
The system we created should be taken into consideration.
In addition to that, their load is heavy. Around 30–31 Turkish Lira of each 100 TL premium paid is going to taxes and to SGK deductions.
Thirdly, technology is developing very fast.
One of these women is thirty-six year old Mehtap Dursun.
Prof. Dr. Kalko gave the young woman urgent surgery.
Dursun was quickly relived of her pains, receiving an oxygen treatment.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Every year, thousands of people face the risk of paralysis because of neck fractures or spinal cord injuries due to diving into shallow waters.
Neck fractures most frequently occur in the fifth or sixth vertebra.
These fractures especially affect the nerves feeding the arm and leg muscles, as well as the respiratory muscles.
Diving into water ranks fourth in the causes of spinal injuries.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar "One shouldn’t be diving into water into which they can’t see".
Prof. Dr. Çağlar continued:
Depending on the level of the vertebra at which the damage occurs, paralysis of varying degrees might occur in the arms and the legs.
A place that looks deep to you might be shallow.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar added that "Although Turkey has twenty-eight provinces having a coastline, unfortunately there isn’t one single warning sign anywhere outside of Istanbul."
The neck must be kept stable, not be moved, and to the extent possible held in place by a hard collar.
The vertebrate of the neck may have been fractured.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
Valdez was 50 years old.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
It's a wrenching decision.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
Don’t lose you teeth while trying to whiten them.
Whitening of the teeth can be attained by the chemical materials applied by dentists or by porcelain surfaces stuck onto the teeth’s surfaces in the same way as nail extensions.
Never use products sold in markets or over the internet to whiten teeth.
That is because these materials scratch the dentin surface, so that teeth are irreversibly colored.
Having lived bedridden in the Uyanis Neighborhood of Kecioren for twenty-four years, the sixty-five year old Koksal Gungor said "My wife heard about Kecioren Municipality’s service."
"My body is paralysed from my neck down and, because of this service, at least I don’t neglect my dental care".
"We are very happy" she said.
A "Seniority" issue in the Turkish army
So, how did this happen?
The Force Commander, Full Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu, had completed his term and would retire anyway...
Now the order for the commandership was due for only remaining full admiral, that is Veysel Kösele.
In this case, there was only one full admiral in the Naval Forces left.
He was supposed to have been appointed to the vacant position. That is number two, Fleet Commander Full Admiral Veysel Kösele.
The government appointed Vice-admiral Adnan Özbal, sixth in rank, to the position.
Now, look at this scene!
Full Admiral Veysel Kösele is there, but a commander of a lower rank is appointed in his place!
A senior is subordinated to the junior one.
I wonder what will happen next?
A full admiral, higher in rank, cannot perform his duties under a lieutenant general, who is his junior.
In this case, Veysel Kösele would not tolerate this painful behavior, he would resign today or tomorrow, and if not, he will be retired.
Dear readers, as I have tried to explain briefly above, the issue of seniority is of paramount importance.
Not just as a rank.
For example, an officer finishing tenth in rank in the Military Academy is more senior than the one finishing eleventh.
We experienced of concrete examples of this seniority issue during the Independence War.
He had two armies under his command.
The Army and the Second Army.
One of them was Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He was offered the army commandership, but he said "İsmet is junior to me, I cannot go under his command".
Another is Yakup Şevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
But, Atatürk convinced him and Yakup Şevki Pasha assumed the commandership of one of our two armies.
A talkative, continuously criticizing soldier.
A commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and on various fronts.
He was also banished to Malta by the British, though he escaped from there and went to Kuşadası and then to Ankara.
But, he was convinced...
Later, Ali İhsan Pasha never got along with Atatürk.
Veysel Kösele is the latest example of this.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
It is our duty to win.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
O man, don’t question too much.
Because no matter how much you learn, there’s always more information.
This is crazy.
The world is flat?
I’m telling you, they are lying to our faces.
You should only seek this truth.
Kyrie Irving, claiming that the earth was flat, is struggling this season with the Cleveland Cavaliers with an average of 24.4 points and 5.9 assists.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.

A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."

"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
Galatasaray’s President will not return empty handed
Galatasaray’s former president, Faruk Süren, had some hard words for the current president, Dursun Özbek, as the later traveled to Bucharest to convince Mircea Lucescu, and to Ankara to obtain Ndiaye’s transfer.
Here is the special statement of the legendary president for SABAH readers:
Galatasaray’s President will not go for nothing and will not return empty handed.

And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.

Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
The issue has also become a big political topic in Europe, with French voters deluged with false stories ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings promptly, ahead of elections there in September.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
"What a personal connection, to hold that letter in my hand."
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
Ah, I love archives!"
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Just let it go, guys!"
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
With his assignment in the castle over, Rhodes is on the hunt for other singular writing experiences.
The Nationalist Movement Party’s Secretary, General Ismet Buyukataman, gave a written statement concerning claims in social media and in the press about recent resignations from the MHP.
Buyukataman continued
"Now they come forward saying ‘A total of 410 people from amongst the MHP’s Kocaeli Golcuk District Organization’s administration and its members, and 215 people from the MHP’s Bursa Yenisehir District have resigned’.
The public is confused by baseless, unfounded news items such as claims of 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
Commenting on how important and indispensable an actor the MHP is in Turkish politics, MHP Secretary General Buyukataman said on the resignations:
All of the comments made, the perception management, all of these have some dirty plot behind them.
It is of no importance to us if those who never contributed positively to our party when they were with us are now resigning.
Saying that "traitors on a leash will go mad and burn to ashes in the fire of factionalism", the MHP’s Buyukataman grouped all the opposition parties and terror groups together, claiming that "From the CHP to the HDP to the Perincek group, from the PKK to FETO, whoever does whatever deed, the Turkish nation’s determination to define its own destiny will never be plotted against."
We have resisted the plans, the new tactics and the plots of a MHP without Turkes, and of a Turkey without the MHP. We have fought to the end against those who want a government without the MHP, a parliament without the MHP.
Saying "The patent for nationalist idealism belongs to the MHP", hinting at Meral Aksener, Buyukataman continued: "Just like the old Turkish film Banker Bilo, how Maho took the villagers on a ride with the pretension of taking them to Germany but instead left them abandoned in the outskirts of Istanbul after many days of a perilous truck journey, it is so obvious that those who have resigned will be abandoned by the cliff side."
This is their problem, and all we want from them is for them to be the new people in their new place.

Columnists commented on the Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
Kadıköy has embraced an excitement and glory that I haven’t been able to find for two seasons...
The brave team that Aykut Kocaman gathered despite many absences was on the green to sign a deal of "stand behind us".
Thirty years ago we gave Atom Ant’s royalty to Rıza Çalımbay.
If he can handle it, it would be the most appropriate comment for the French player.
Alper’s playing at the front, staying in the second striker’s position left Sturm Graz team "stranded" on the field for long periods of time.
They control the ball but then cannot generate any effective passes in the opponent’s penalty area.
This outlook might bring about the comment a "center-forward is needed", but hesitating to pass to Ahmethan, we are up against a game that cannot get its only center-forward into position.
Aykut Kocaman’s machine is setting its driving spring and just needs some more time.
As for physical quality, there are in good shape.
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
Modern sex dolls have evolved out of their blow-up counterparts into robots with a silicon skin that is warm to the touch - with deliberately human-like responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" that gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.

Last words: "I think I am dying, farewell mom"
Among the people who died in London’s Grenfell Tower fire that so far has resulted in thirty confirmed deaths was an Italian citizen, Gloria Trevisan, and her boyfriend.
Relating how the young people’s families are undergoing a time of great sorrow, the lawyer told journalists to not insist on obtaining statements from them.
I think I am dying, farewell mom
There’s a little smoke, but don’t worry, we’re waiting to be rescued.
Mom, my whole life is flashing before my eyes.
I am going to heaven and I’ll help you from there.
This is Italy’s drama: being unable to provide jobs for her youth.
Last year alone, more than 110,000 people left Italy due to unemployment.
But a new study claims quite the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy treats could help relieve symptoms of sufferers of inflammatory bowel disease.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Lead investigator Dr Marco Colonna explained immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food don't sneak into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial species present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.

British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging for the helicopter to be displayed on the South Lawn.
"To place a cost to taxpayers based on the reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.

GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
Necip and Utku to remain at Beşiktaş for four more years
The Beşiktaş Club have extended the contracts of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran for four years.
In the football data section of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) website, it was observed that Beşiktaş have extended the two players’ contracts until 31 May 2021.
Brought up through Beşiktaş’s youth team, Necip signed his first professional contract on 19 June 2008 and donned the A Team’s uniform for the 2009–2010 season.
The TFF website also included the goalkeeper Utku Yuvakuran’s transfer fee, whom Beşiktaş had had on load before signing a contract with him until 31 May 2021.
Beşiktaş had Utku Yuvakuran on loan last season, playing mostly in the under-21 league.
The young goal keeper only played for Beşiktaş in two Turkey Cup matches.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.

The German individual connected to DAESH is reported to be a 27 year old German citizen from the city of Solingen city in the Northern Rhine-Westphalia state.
This person was found to have traveled in the autumn of 2012 autumn first to Egypt, then to Turkey and lastly to Syria.
The German Law Enforcement Agency did not respond to the newspaper’s questions on the issue.
According to allegations, M.K. and O.A. from the group had from time to time shot in the air with pump-action shotguns.
M.K. fired a single shot into the ground with pump-action shotgun while passing by a playground full of children.
Yildizsu’s grandmother, Meryem Kaya, described those moments to DHA.
The youths started dispersing.
We were going to leave as soon as it was finished.
Just at that moment a gun was fired, it happened right in front of me.
We talked to the doctor and this is what he said.
They extracted one of the buckshot while the other remained in her eye.
The suspects, M.K. and O.A., were captured and detained by the Eyüp District’s Security Directorate’s Public Security team.
