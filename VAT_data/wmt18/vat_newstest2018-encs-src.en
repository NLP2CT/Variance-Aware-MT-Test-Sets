Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
Model killed by a chef.
Twelve years later, her family still has no peace!
The police convicted him three years later.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting on the fateful night.
According to his testimony, the girl defended herself as best she could, but it was in vain.
Lewis supposedly stabbed her on the street.
Dixie's version was been proven to be a lie and inculpated him.
He said that he felt adrenalin.
"So our daughter is not there anymore," Linda, the mother of the late girl, told The Mirror, describing the disappearance of the urn and ashes.
Linda waited for the vandals, but they always attacked when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands of crowns.
including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike tour in Moravia.
However, one of them did not just bring a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual looking vibrators.
When his associate left to take up another position, he replaced him.
Today he runs the Intimity boutique in Prague's Benediktská ulice, where he sells sex toys in the way luxury handbags or shoes are often presented.
They are also designer items.
Come on, don’t be such puritans!
It opened in 2010 and was based on a completely different concept of the erotic store to what everyone is used to here.
Both of them liked the name Intimity.
In the end, the variation that won saw the shop displayed as a garden of delights and a bedroom, dominated by beds.
Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio made it for us.
We found the space in 2013.
It should be the kind of shop they aren't ashamed to enter.
As soon as I got to the door I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
"Men usually can not guess the right size, and they usually opt for one that is too big," chuckled Martin over the frequent mistake.
The absolute bestseller at the moment is the appropriately named Satisfyer.
I feel the adolescent need to chuckle with admiration for the serious tone with which my comment is handled.
As if it didn't phase him at all.
"They make various kinds," he continued.
That's the most popular category.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they are only used externally.
It's hard to say, but it seems like this kind of concept would also work exclusively for men.
The question is what to offer men," mulled Martin.
"We have aids for them too, but only to a limited extent." Masturbators are the most sold, in our case those produced by Tenga.
There is a lot of focus on functionality and user experience.
It's completely different in Japan, however.
I thought the Japanese women were very picky about sex toys.
Banal truth is quite different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are generally associated with being used by women.
Czech men and women aren't at all prudish.
They come for something nice and high quality, either for a fulfilling life with partner or just for themselves. To ensure that these customers keep coming back, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňek Šebelka take care to check every product to make sure it's actually functional.
We don't want to get involved in any specialism, such as bondage or latex, because we don't have a place for that, it doesn't exactly fit.
It's enjoyable to know that a Czech woman was behind the design, specifically the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised how many people buy the designer Whoop.de.doo products by Anna Marešová from us, even though they are relatively expensive.
There are customers who go directly to the Venus Balls by Anna Marešová.
Anna's story started as a school project.
Now it is a finished product that is produced in our country.
I wanted to have control over the production process and I also wanted to know with what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Maybe I'm going against the current a bit, but it seems important to me to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
Next year, she plans to offer vibrating eggs and other new items.
I'm interested in where the border lies of what's acceptable.
Is there something that Martin Ráž wouldn't sell?
What seems normal to one person may seem totally abnormal to someone else, so we define ourselves by our assortment of branded products.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest request they received?
But the question remains if someone was making fun of us," said Martin, casting me a suspicious look.
A blow for Karel Gott.
Karel Gott's best friend is fighting against the disease that robs people of all their memory.
I know about my illness, and I can handle it all given the circumstances.
The whole branch of the family has come together to make life easier for Karel.
He longs to keep singing.
"I keep repeating song lyrics so I won't forget them," Karel admitted.
The actress Květa Fialová is currently struggling against the same disease in a home.
Do you have patients with Alzheimer's in your family?
"I am sorry that the lawmakers filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court, so that now there will be ten people deciding on what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
According to the Spanish paper El País, similar exceptions existed in Chile since 1931, which was before women were given the right to vote in 1949.
The total ban on abortions was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidential office.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are currently behind bars, serving prison sentences of up to 30 years for the termination of their pregnancies.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
As for my captain's speech?
So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
He chafed at the criticism, sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
But he did not silence them.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Czechs have quickly taken to free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
They travel in Austria most often, but in the summer season the consumption of data is dominated by Croatia.
This is how a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks now that customers can use services by local operators as part of their home tariffs.
It's no wonder, then, that in Croatia, where a minimal amount of our countrymen go in winter, consumption of data rose by as much as fifty times this summer.
Italy ranked second in the list of consumed data.
The record was 7 July.
The number of minutes used while roaming double in relation to the previous year.
Germany dominates with a huge lead over other countries.
"Calls while roaming are more likely to be made by business customers on work trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.
Polygamy is common here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I'm tired."
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Bread is just as out of reach.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
The consignment was headed to Australia.
Australia is an attractive target for smugglers because of the high street prices of drug.
The country is also struggling with a growing number of people with drug addictions.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large number of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific in a small plane.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in their body decreases.
"And they also lose their sense of thirst, so seniors generally drink less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly," said Mádlová.
They should definitely drink two litres.
"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, and starts talking in a confused way," she added.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, at most they should have cotton sheets.
Disposable incontinence pants may also be a problem.
"It's more demanding on the nursing staff, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient occasionally and let the skin breathe," the doctor explained.
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."
A man carries out an acid attack but the court declares him not dangerous.
You never know what can happen to you.
One moment, you're at home laughing with your family, and the next your whole life is shaken to the core.
And the worst thing is that you can't do anything about it at all.
This is the fate that met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was burned with acid by an unknown attacker who was eventually acquitted.
Reuters reported on the story.
Instead, a terrible surprise awaited him.
A man he had never seen in his life poured acid on him without warning as soon as he opened up, saying, "That's for you, friend."
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his relatives learned terrible news there - the doctors said he had no chance to survive.
Ninety percent of his face was affected, and the doctors attempted to piece it back together with skin from other parts of the patient's body.
Even after demanding, long-term treatment, the victims still have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people do not recover, and they fight deformity and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Peter Dziewulski, a spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
In terms of the attack, Christopheros is convinced that the unknown man must have confused him with someone else.
The police investigated the case thoroughly and finally tracked down the assailant.
The number attacks using corrosive substances has increased considerably over the past few years.
However, the victims of these attacks are unwilling to give up.
They are demanding that the UK Government enforce stricter and longer prison sentences for people attacking their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
According to the Dubai civil defences, the inhabitants of the eighty-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Moreover, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downwards, with glowing debris falling down.
We were woken up by the alarm, people were yelling.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when parts of the burning building crashed down on them.
The fire was under control after about two hours, according to civil defence reports.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the electricity cut out.
Nothing happened to anyone then either, as the inhabitants were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and was then the highest residential building in the world, at 352 metres tall.
A bodybuilder had an unbelievable 14 doping substances in his body.
And he still didn't win.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample from 23-year-old Ippolita revealed a large collection of illicit aids - from steroids to diuretics and medicine for Parkinson's or anorexia.
Now the bodybuilder is facing a four-year ban and criminal prosecution.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record among all the athletes ever caught.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
As soon as Lucka Vondráčková sets foot in the Czech Republic, she's on the go.
Last time, her former lover Michal Dlouhý, who lived with her for three years, fell into her arms.
At first they ignored each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes, to the point where she ended up clutching her belly.
Then they hugged and willingly posed for the photographers.
Their encounter was not a coincidence, however, as they will play a loving couple in the new Prima series Kapitán Exner.
Islamists receive a life sentence in the UK for planning an attack.
On Thursday, the British court issued life sentences to four members of the Islamist cell that called itself Three Musketeers, which planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
The authorities then thought they were about to attack very soon.
This happened when the MI5 secret service officer placed a listening device in the car.
Three of the men sentenced are aged 28, 25 and 33, and they may file for release after 20 years.
The court also heard their claims, but the defendants' allegations were dismissed.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
38.3°C was recorded in Hodonín.
When 38.3 degrees Celsius was recorded in Strážnice, Hodonín, Thursday surpassed the previous peak, making it the hottest day this year.
On Tuesday, records were beaten or matched in 35 of the 145 meteorological stations, which have been measuring the weather for over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations saw new record temperatures set on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice the temperature during the day on Thurday was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
The high temperatures on Thursday mainly occurred in the south and east of Moravia.
After Straznice, the biggest heat was in Dyjakovice, near Znojmo, and Brod nad Dyje, near Břeclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not beat the record.
According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the current heat in the Czech Republic will fade erode and there could be heavy rain on Sunday.
China is lacking tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of the national visa policies.
It spends 10 billion dollars a year to support language schools and establish universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry towards foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
It isn't doing anything for Beijing, however.
The local state media has been talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernisation.
However, the number of visitors grew by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent China's tourists came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
As such, the Chinese offices in the US have crowds comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
These kinds of restrictions create significant economic barriers.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans went to Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and is home to less than one percent of its population.
According to a recently published report by the Fed (the American Federal Reserve), up to 190 billion dollars may have left China as a result of foreign trips by Chinese people, while China only gains around 35 billion dollars a year through sales of foreign currency to incoming tourists.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more a general restraint in relation to foreigners.
In many parts of China, practically nobody has heard about immigrants.
Even Japan, which is not known as the crossroads of immigration, has twice as many foreign inhabitants.
It is almost impossible to find in China, however.
Other Asian countries, especially India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
The number of deadly poisonous reptiles at Pilsen Zoo has increased.
At the Království jedu (Poison Kingdom) in Pilsen, visitors can now look forward to seeing the young of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, at altitudes of up to 2000 metres.
The young of the other two species, the death adders and the red cobras, will gain strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We still cannot say when people will see them.
"We wouldn't want to lose them," said the carer Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
There was a hundred percent success rate for a group of African spitting red cobras.
The pair in Pilsen Zoo hatched four babies out of four eggs.
Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."
Tusk testifies at the prosecutor's office again regarding Smolensk.
Tusk thanked them for their support and assured them his conscience was clear: "I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski doesn't intimidate me."
This was his second time at the hearing.
This was the second time the ex-prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor's office, and on this occasion he was questioned over mistakes during the autopsies of the Smolensk disaster victims.
In addition, there was discussion on bodies being changed in the coffins.
The families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason behind it.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, in spite of such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk very important in the EU," said Kaczyński to the Catholic television channel Trwam.
Tusk endured an eight-hour examination at the Prosecutor's Office on 19 April.
He didn't testified as a suspect, however, only as a witness.
However, many people considered his summons to be part of the apparent effort of the Polish government and Law and Justice leader Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him with various scandals.
Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydło protested the prolongation of Tusk's mandate at the EU summit.
Burma and Senegal.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that have to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry explained.
More than one hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot sheet to be printed.
The list of which ones is changing with the decree, however.
Both embassies are now closed.
The Czech Republic also ended its representation in Bamako, Mali and Kyoto, Japan.
People will also not be able to vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
That was closed by the Czech Republic in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
Since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation in Asia through the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq and Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province.
Voting cards will also be available for voters registered at the Czech Embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The first time was in 2002, when it was decided among the South Moravian candidates.
Some 3800 people voted the first time 15 years ago, then about 6700 in 2006 and 8222 four years later.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks put it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.
Greene laughs the hardest.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
I love user instructions.
I look back with nostalgia on the distant past, when user instructions for anything were a rare phenomenon.
With a grin, he advised me what the labyrinthine paper was suitable for.
It was a well-established aid during a chronic lack of toilet paper.
He playfully found the broken wire and allowed me to listen to my dear records again.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer which just needed a grapefruit pressed down on it required about ten pictures.
The drawing with a description of how to insert one piece into another was especially charming.
It was simple.
After a total of three steps, the job should have been done.
the bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the battery cover.
At first I expected that inserting my upper right limb into the guts of the car would allow me to find a spring or a screw so I could detach the cover easily, and then I would follow points 1-3 suggested by the thrifty author of the service book.
That cover had no place, no space for a slender Cinderella-esque hand, let alone that of an obese Silesian.
I lost half an hour of my life with no success to show for it whatsoever.
"What are you doing in here?" she asked ingenuously.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I omit the vulgar terms only two publishable words remain.
I thought that nothing could surprise me.
I know him as a composed colleague who has experienced both the possible and impossible in the field and who is able to recount wild stories in an unpeturbed voice.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it did not go flawlessly.
At one point, however, he struck him directly on the nose so hard that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
Fortunately, the injury was serious enough to stop the shoot from continuing.
The unsuccessful version where he was bleeding was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Best of luck to you."
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
Lomachenko agreed.
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
An extensive search for them was carried out, but to no avail.
The families of the missing couple lived not knowing whether they would ever find out what happened to them.
The police only managed to identify the couple through the documents left in the car.
The documents survived an entire decade underwater, and without them the police would have taken much longer to determine the identities of the couple found.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed his father's car to pick his girlfriend up from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
Investigators believe that the young couple's death was an accident caused by the icy road that runs around the river.
However, the investigation is continued, and further details will be published once it has been closed.
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.
Trump threatens the President of Mexico over the phone.
In a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto this January, American President Donald Trump threatened that he wouldn't meet him if he publicly stated that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.
Similarly, Trump also spoke openly to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This has emerged from transcripts of the talks published by the US daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
In Trump's first interview with the Mexican President shortly after he took office, he undiplomatically rebuked Peña Nieta for criticising his wall-building plan.
He will figure out the funding somehow and it will work out eventually.
Trump issued the executive order to build the wall shortly after coming to power.
At the end of March, Trump said that the United States would pay for the project.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
This was the outcome of an exchange of views on the agreement that will see Australia grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internment facilities in the Pacific Island states.
At first Trump considered the deal to be absurd, but later conceded to it.
In some parts, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump approved of Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," joked Trump.
"I hate accepting these people," said Trump.
They're bad, I can assure you.
That's why they're in prison now.
Trump had telephone conversations with a large number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House. He often spoke to several leaders in a single day.
Her father also watched.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighbourhood, as his victim.
He then raped her body, which he tossed near a mosque.
The young girl's violent death affected the entire country, which is currently facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was in the first row of a thousand-person crowd, which gathered together to witness the execution.
After the execution, the victim's father shared his feelings with the media.
I feel a new person.
Other members of the family were also present, shouting the slogan "long live justice" along with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square in a police van, which he was then dragged out of.
One of the members turned his weapon against him, firing a shot from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd present celebrated each round that was fired.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia Law have won," he added.
We took Rana's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered in the square would succumb to hateful madness, grab the killer and lynch him.
The execution was ordered by a court under the law of the Shiite Houthis.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on 27 June.
Rana's family knew him well.
Even a beast would have been more merciful to Rana.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, and we informed the police the same day. We told the newspapers and all the TV stations, and there posters with her photo hanging everywhere," he continued.
It is generally believed the police got a tip off from the murderer's parents, who suspected their son of the atrocity.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
The residents of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began gathering in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held, demanding immediate punishment.
The accused apparently showed no regret for his actions.
Police officers read out the sentence just before the deed was carried out, but the convict only glanced at his executioner briefly.
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
The rally erupted in cheers.
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
The CzechTrade national commission is won by František Savov's company, who is prosecuted by the state.
The public commission by the CzechTrade state export agency was given to František Savov's publishing house Mladá fronta.
They did not mind the fact that the Czech state is prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The commission was awarded to entrepreneur František Savov of the Mladá fronta publishing house and has a total value of 30.8 million crowns.
The case was noted on the server Aktualne.cz.
Savov's company was substantially helped by the second criterion.
It was this result that put it ahead of the second-best candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing house, which offered a better price.
The VLM publishing company has issued several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
After their rejection, they decided to contest the outcome with the ÚOHS Úřadu pro ochranu hospodářské soutěže (Office for the Protection of Competitions).
It believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of VLM, the selection committee's scores appear unjustified, and the 100% evaluation of Mladá fronta by all its members extremely suspicious.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
All the information about the above contract is lawfully published in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the public tender notice.
"A full written report will be published after the completion of the contract, but during the term of the contract we can not express our opinion about it," said Štěpán Dlouhý, media agent for Dotyk.cz.
They may have been helped in the tender by the fact that they provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal for the previous four years.
The police accuses František Savov of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions for his companies, which caused the Czech state damages of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been requesting Great Britain for his extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the person behind his criminalisation is head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose sphere of influence includes the Mafra publishing house.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved since last year, and we have not received any notification from the UK yet," Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokesman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
It should also control Heavier Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
The biker aroused attention with a reckless ride along the streets, pavements and parks in Úsovice.
Finally, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, and carried the injured biker to a hospital in Pilsen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
Sparta midfielder Rosický: Changes are painful, but we have to keep believing.
Sixteen thousand fans were up on their feet applauding.
This was the same scene as the Sunday match against the Bohemians.
Was it hard to make something out of the match after the goal by Belgrade?
After the goal was scored, we needed to score four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to avoid losing at least, so as to build up our self-confidence to get something out of it for the next match.
Of course, that's very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
Of course, this is one of the pains you have to deal with when a new team is formed.
The coach needs to find the ideal 11 that fit together.
Is it encouraging for you to have played for part of two matches in a row?
They're still just parts of the match.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place within Sparta?
It's the same as with injuries.
The fans came back in large numbers, but when they left they were embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
I'm really sorry that we couldn't make them happy with a better performance.
We can thank them for coming.
Can a cupless season be at least an advantage for the league?
At the moment we're fighting against ourselves. We will keep playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
The calculated damage amounts to 645 million Czech crowns.
However, the Constitutional Judges found the complaint to be unjustified, as CTK learned from the court database.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict took effect in November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
The penalty imposed is in the higher end of the statutory limitations, which corresponds to the damage incurred according to the verdict.
The High Court described the case as extreme tax evasion that had a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors for the company World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damages of 645 million Czech crowns only refer to the period from January to July 2008, and according to an expert the total evasion exceeded one billion.
For procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to try Toman for the full amount.
According to the charges, World Servis did not include complete invoices in its tax returns.
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
During its congress in London, the IAAF International Athletics Federation upheld the international ban preventing the Russian athletes from starting because of the state-sponsored doping programme.
The result vote regarding the world championships, which begin on Friday, was unambiguous, as expected.
His group recommended that the ban be upheld.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, meaning Russian athletes were not able to attend last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming international championships, 19 Russians who have previously proved they have been tested outside of the Russian anti-doping system for a long time will participate.
However, they will not be able to start championships wearing the national colours, and in the event of a victory, the Russian anthem will not be played.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
California is strongly pro LGBT, and any disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle is seen as discrimination.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has placed a ban on funding its citizens' journeys to eight states from its own means.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions in Tennessee, for example, with the financial support of their schools.
It is placing the embargo as retaliation for the California embargo on Tennessee.
At the same time, it called on the parliaments of all the states to stop this madness.
First of all, all of this is constitutional. No part of it is unconstitutional.
In Colorado, one baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But California wants California to be California, and Texas and seven other states to also be California!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once legitimately fought for their lifestyle to be tolerated.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalised.
The only case was the in 1950s, and the political cause was slavery, and the war by the North against the South.
The cultural and political divide between the blue Democratic states and the red Republican states is widening, and the US is disconnecting internally on a mental level.
Illegal agitation.
A critic of Putin received a hefty fine.
A court imposed a fine on him for calling on people to participate in unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has organised two large anti-government street protests over the past two months, and announced that he is setting his sights on the head of state position in March next year.
Current head of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said that the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling people to demonstrations through videos on the YouTube internet portal.
In addition to the 300,000 roubles, on Thursday the court also imposed fines 25,000 roubles on two members of Navalny's pre-election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figured on the fragmented opposition scene.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for stealing from the Kirovles forestry company.
The verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeals in May.
The ruling is so final that it prevents Navalny from nominating himself under Russian law.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
Teachers hose down children.
The 35 children who attend the Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4 are only able to go outside in the morning.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classroom, where the blinds and curtains are drawn.
"But it doesn't help much," she added.
There are better conditions at the Na Hrázi forest kindergarten in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have fully grown trees on the land, so we can stay underneath them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree with a table under it, and we do different things there," said Barbora Kompanová, the director of the kindergarten.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
Drivers receive water or a summer uniform.
The tram and bus drivers' cabins are air conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
The tram tracks have not been seriously damaged by the high-temperatures.
At the current high temperatures, we must pay particular attention to make sure that a sufficient number of drinks are available to the drivers.
The hot, dry weather of the past few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic extinguished 108, which is twice the daily average.
The firefighters were not even brought any relief evening by the changes in the weather in the evening, as in many places the heat was replaced by storms and torrential rain.
In particular, many of the calls required them to remove fallen trees and branches.
However, the help of firefighters was also required in Stvolinek, Česká Lípa, where 60 people from the children's camp had to be evacuated to safety because of the storm.
The tropical temperatures also created work for rescuers in Prague.
On Tuesday and on Wednesday night, ambulances were called out to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from boilers.
As such, people should have their water heaters checked, rescue services warned.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Okay.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
How'd that work out?
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.
The husband of an MEP was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was picked up by a special government plane.
The government special plane brought the injured Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
He is said to have been hit by a car, and has been in serious condition since then.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialised department in one of Bratislava's hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from the NOVA party.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
During hot summer days, it's tempting just to wear the bare essentials that cover the most intimate places.
At an afternoon encounter at Prague Zoo, swarming with actors, moderators, singers and everyone involved with TV Prima, she covered her body in a mini overall.
All it took was a few normal moves for the model to show everyone her silicon and even her behind.
Her overalls cut into her thighs several times, plus she was so tall that she had to keep adjusting them.
She was certainly not lacking the attention of the gentlemen and photographers present.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
"She has shown no remorse."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
Plane makes an emergency landing on the beach.
A man and a little girl die.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the plane.

D11, or how not to build a motorway.
Can the motorways in the Czech Republic ever be finished?
What is it?
Construction on another section of it has recently halted by the Děti Země (Children of the Earth) movement for at least several months.
We Eastern Bohemians are getting our motorway in pieces, like cutting slices off a salami.
We're not asking for miracles, though.
We just want to shorten driving times and to divert trucks going to or from Poland away from villages and towns.
The final stretch of our dream motorway was begun in 2008, that is, an unbelievable nine years ago.
Last week it was announced that construction will not take place this year.
And maybe not next year either.
Děti Země is repeating its tactics from D1.
What did Děti Země request?

Provence lavender under threat from climate change
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
He would always wear his hat.
"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The landscape constantly shifts.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
Dozens of firefighters arrived on the scene, assisted by a helicopter.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, and the firefighters declared a level three alarm out of a possible four.
Dozens of both professional and volunteer firemen fought the blaze on the spot.
A helicopter helped to extinguish it by delivering six loads of water.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Police charge three people, one of whom is a minor.
The police have charged three men with the setting up fire to a precious wooden church in Třinec-Guty, Frýdek-Místek on Wednesday.
One of the accused is a juvenile, and all three are Czech nationals.
Moravian-Silesian police chief Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.
In his view, it was a deliberate crime.
He could not disclose any further information.
The wooden church of the "Body of God" in Gute dates back to the 16th century
Questions were raised about the restoration of the church shortly after the fire began.
The majority of the costs should be covered by the insurance policy, and the Ministry of Culture and the municipality are ready to pay extra costs. A public collection is also being prepared, and they are counting on contributions from the landowner, which is the local parish.
The similar 16th century wooden church of St. Catherine in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
At that time, it was caused by an electrical installation.
An exact copy was created in its place.
It will support their training.
By offering financial support for the state-sponsored organisations, the aim of the law on citizens' preparedness for defence of the state is counting on voluntary shooting training, or teams of trainers.
This results from the proposal prepared by the ministry.
Were the law to be adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support its defence.
For example, the state would support ham radio, shooting or dog training societies financially or materially, boosting the capabilities of their members.
Accredited instructors would also be available to assist the associations and other interested parties in the training or education.
It also includes the organisation of talks with war veterans or people who have acted heroically.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
Thursday becomes the hottest day
It surpassed Tuesday, which had previously been the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The announcement was made by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
The heatwave mainly affected Moravia, while in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were beaten or matched in 35 of the 145 meteorological stations, which have been measuring the weather for over 30 years.
For example, in Strážnice the temperature during the day was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
The high temperatures mainly occurred in the south and east of Moravia.
After Straznice, the biggest heat was in Dyjakovice, near Znojmo, and Brod nad Dyje, near Břeclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not beat the record.
According to the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ČHMÚ), the current heat in the Czech Republic will fade erode and there could be heavy rain on Sunday.
They want to adjudicate directly, and because not all of them are as bold as Andrel Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Along with other colleagues behind Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, Penta owner Marek Dospiva sponsors Robejšek's Realisty.
The second life of the Občanské demokratické aliance (Civic Democratic Alliance) is funded by insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also its chairman
Convicted corrupter and Czech gambling king Ivo Valenta bought up the Strana soukromníků (Freeholder Party).
The Agrofert political movement, as the project by Andrej Babiš unintentionally named by the Mayor of Kroměříž Jaroslav Němec, deserves a whole chapter for itself.
The man in question is Dalibor Dědek, owner of the security equipment company Jablotron.
In his own words, he entered politics to do good.
Dědek's entrance in mayoral colours did not get off to a good start, however.
Which is to say that my goal is for the ANO movement, the Starostové movement to get 20 percent in the elections.
Dědek's slip of the tongue is rather symptomatic, however.
He certainly is not going into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
Babiš will remain a hero to me.
He said he wanted the Starostové to learn to imagine a possible collaboration with Babiš.
Others still may ask whether the boss of Jablotron parted ways from the boss of Agrofert as part of a bad business deal, and is now looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
Dědek's first public appearances did not all revolve around Babiš, however.
The political division of Vit Bárta's security agency, TOP 09, and the Civic Democrats came together for nearly thirty million.
The law forbids anyone to give more than three million to a political party.
When Dědek entered politics, he could at least have studied the rules of the game.
Perhaps then he would not have had to ask why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
People with a university education earn about 50,000 crowns per month in our country.
Someone earning 50,000 is rich under the local conditions.
In short, rich people must be helped so that they do not have to face poverty.
Thanks to Dědek, the rest of us can confirm the fact that billionaires are not good people.
To my mind, it should be those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
Selling real estate isn't always easy.
Often, it isn't even helped by having 11 bedrooms and a wonderful view of the sea, or by the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price had to be reduced by a staggering £8 million.
The Mirror.co.uk reported on the sale.
The brochure describing the lots states: "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Donald Trump had to slash the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, but the final price dropped to £13 million.
It consists of amazing 5-acre estate on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, with 12 fully equipped bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, numerous dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
There are dozens of palms planted on the plot.
According to real estate experts, the price reflected the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the estate is closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculations, he is thought to have paid about £15 million.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin,
Another property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5 million.
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because, back then, you lit a fire for light.
Ah, I love archives!"
He wandered the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners and sometimes the artists at work on his book's illustrations.
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
She can be sleepy, conversational or she can 'be in the mood'!"
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
They cannot break up with their companion, or walk out.
They have no agency or back-story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that may disrupt the fantasy of total servitude.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
Curry is fighting to make the cut in California.
The two-time holder of the record for the most-valuable NBA player took part in the Egoie Mae Classic, a lower series run by Web.com Tour in Hayward, California. He ended his first round with 74 shots and will keep fighting to make the cut.
Golden State point guard, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously, and his first shot ended up in the drink holder of a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate as on the basketball court, but he had a dozen professionals behind him on the scoreboard with four-over-par.
The event in Hayward is his first time starting in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He was granted a sponsor's exception to take part in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained amateur status.
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
Less remarked on is the power of Trump to bring families together.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
The left has been invigorated by Trump, but the warping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all rightwards.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a young panda that mated in the wild has given birth in captivity.
The panda rescue programme is a huge success.
Centre worker Chang Chi-Chung told New China that panda breeding is at risk of inbreeding.
There were only 471 pandas living in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
The effort to mate captured pandas with wild ones is the first step to help protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cao Cao was released into a nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on 11 March.
Cao Cao met her chosen mate 12 days later.
Males are bad at estimating the time when the female is ready, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians Were Detained For Illegal Camping in Greece
A group of illegally camping people, including the two Bulgarians, was detained by the police in Sithonia in the morning of August 1.
She passed through the course in Kingsbarns, Scotland with a score of one below par, hitting three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player is hoping that she will make the cut for the first time at a famous majors contest.
The competition with a $3.25 million prize started off best for American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round with a record of 64 putts, and a score of eight under par.
The Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms because of the incident.
Eggs from Belgium were last seen in the Czech Republic in April, and eggs from the Netherlands were last imported in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
However, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands present in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is is used in treatments against fleas, lice and ticks.

I would like to play for another 10 years.
"Maybe I'll go back one day," smiled the 27-year-old Sedlacek, who could start the season in a jersey for Zlin.
It depends on whether he finds an engagement before the start of the new year.
How were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like in school, then three.
I didn't play much the first year, I had an experienced goalie above me.
I was learning.
Before the third season I thought they would give me more space.
Last year, I assumed I would play all the time.
But we only got five points in the first ten games, so the coaches began to change things around.
My teammate ended up playing more often.
It's a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'll miss it.
I found a girlfriend there.
The top ten teams are really high quality.
That means playing more towards the rear, fighting more.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to keep playing.
They shoot more in the Czech Republic.
Like a national team.
Everyone supports them.
Even when things were going badly, a lot of people would come.
Did Dinamo's activities in the KHL help Latvia to move to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been going since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
They've reached a higher level thanks to the KHL.
More and more Latvian players are setting their sights on the Czech Extraliga.
Why is it that so many of them go there?
Why is it that you still don't have a position?
Sparta was on the table.
But since they didn't have a budget for a goalkeeper we didn't come to an agreement.
It was classic.
So now I'm training back home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about that?
I did some playing in the KHL, so I see it differently now.
The question is when and where I'll sign.
Now all I can do is wait to see what my agent arranges.
Do you have a preference for a particular competition?
Given how last season went, I'm not really in a position to choose.
The government trip to Lety continues.
There has been talk about the camp in Lety for many years.
For the readers who do not know exactly what's going on, it's probably best if they look at the official cultural heritage site of Pietní místo Lety, for example.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, it states that the camp lay two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that it served as a labour camp from 8 August 1940, as a displaced persons camp from 1 January 1942 and became a Roma camp on 2 August 1942.
The overall total was 420.
There is no question about the need to remember these events constantly.
During socialism, the camp was slightly forgotten about, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and on the part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, and a memorial was erected at Lety in 1995.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but so far it has not happened.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
These are facts about the camp's post-war fate in brief.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government is rumoured to buying the pig farm back after.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some figures, but I would probably upset the plans if I went to the public with them."
In any case, it will definitely not be a cheap matter.
And just a few hundred metres from the former camp is a memorial in which the state invested almost 10 million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction were funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which obviously is not likely, in my opinion it would still be a waste of money.
I don't see any reason to change it!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister do not represent the whole government.
This May I went directly to the place to see it.
There are a lot of flowers and wreaths.
Archaeological research is currently taking place on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible to preserve some of the uncovered foundations, for example, and at least make them accessible in an appropriate visual manner.
If he succeeds in pushing the government to buy a pig farm with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic time in the role of Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
He's taking his participation in Pohlreich's new show very seriously.
It is time to move up a level and learn from the master.
Pohlreich did not comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show "Ano, šéfe!"
Prima has only reacted to Hruška's participation in the cooking academy by treating the whole thing as his personal activity outside of television.
In the last episode of his show "Teď vaří šéf" in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed-out pear ("hruška" in Czech) ironed onto his shirt.
If my face was there, I would laugh a lot.
He has his own thoughts on Láďa's cooking.
I highly appreciate Zdeněk Pohlreich, even if he things I make chicken with honey.
He's a moron!
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand

White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
The girl set off to the beach at around 2 o'clock in the morning on Sunday.
Instead of swimming, she got trapped in the wetlands.
Several police patrols went to the site she described, but finding the young woman was no easy task.
She was at the end of both her physical and mental strength, and showed signs of hypothermia.
As a result, she was taken to the Českolipská hospital by ambulance.
Is there a link between Dědka and STAN?
From sought-after bride to sales girl.
There's a touch of irony involved.
Gazdík has not only defined himself against Andrey Babiš's ANO party for a long time, in their first joint press conference Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated: "My goal is for the ANO movement, the Starostové movement, to gains 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
For some time now, STAN has been acting more like a reality show than a real political party, and Dědek's helping hand seems to be making a shop assistant out of a sought-after bride.
Police dogs trained in helicopter flights in Most
Dogs specialised in hunting explosives and search dogs were trained in a helicopter flight over Most lake today.
At Most, previously educated dogs were trained like adults, and those who are not yet trained just passed by.
In addition to the standard training, which involves being exposed to specimens of explosives around the lake and looking for a lost figurine, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
"They are usually kept in the garden by the handlers, for example," Tomas added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specialties in the Ústí region.
German shepherds are the dominant breed, but there are also a growing number of Belgian shepherds.
The handlers take care of them from the time they are puppies.
The animals undergo repeated veterinary tests to reveal any possible health issues or disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and not timid, they take the first test at 20 months.
Despite season two of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Season three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the former receiving its first trailer, teasing the show's upcoming villains.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" just with more government bribes and violent actions.
Season three of Narcos will debut 1 September.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million total registered voters.
Unique brewery brews beer once again.
The newly revived brewery is back serving up good beer.
This was followed by years of prosperity, when the brewery was especially famous for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was stopped during World War II and the brewery was nationalised in 1984.
The abandoned site was devastated and stripped for building materials.
However, in 2007 new hopes emerged in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouza.
Their work has been rewarded by a declaration from Ministry of Culture proclaiming the brewery to be a cultural monument, and the building has also become part of the European Industrial Heritage Trail.
In 2015, they festively revived the tradition of beer brewing.
Thanks to enthusiasts from the Stachelberg society, who started to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990, you can also see it for yourselves.
Unfortunately, the list it belongs to is that of unique buildings that are in danger of collapse.
However, its devotees do not want to give up, and a lot of events are being held to support the monastery.
Do you want to look a Neanderthal in the face?
You will find out how the Neanderthals were able to cope perfectly with all sorts of extreme climate conditions, especially with the alternation of ice and inter-glacial ages.
Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful as the predators of their time.
You wouldn't call them Neanderthals?

Identify plants with one click.
All they have to do is take a photo of the plant and the application will recognise the species.
The new application is available for both iOS and Android, and was presented on Tuesday by a representative of the CEEV Centra etické a environmentální výchovy (Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education) in Horský Park in Bratislava, as part of the Tajný život města (Secret Life of the City) project.
The French allowed the application to be translated into Slovak and Czech as part of the Tajný život města project.
As such, users are welcome to add plants that do not yet appear in the database once they have created an account.
GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
It added employees and union representatives "will be the first to know" if there were any changes to its operations.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
"We respect all clubs.
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
Does the political penalty have broadly understandable rules?
These things can't be lumped together.
Madura's Venezuela has indeed set out on the road to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is just not behaving in the way the American president would like.
Russia is a whole chapter in itself.
So why such a fuss?
It was a terrible prospect.
Trump has not relaxed the sanctions, but actually tightened them.
But then, the EU's anti-Russian sanctions aren't kosher either.
European Commission chief Juncker is once again complaining that Trump's sanctions are threatening the EU's energy security.
Does that mean that only sanctions that are too weak to threaten anyone should be used?
China is berated for not meddling enough.
But can anyone see a system, order or rule?
Andrej Babiš: I will not consider cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš got married, toured the Republic with his visionary book and finalised the electoral programme.
Except for the Pardubice Region, all the candidates have already been prepared.
To use his own words, he did not interfere with them in any way.
He even agreed to allow "hejtman" (marshall) and Shadow Education Minister Ivo Vondrák lead the Moravian-Silesian region.
You have upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with the idea that directly elected mayors and chief magistrates should manage municipalities and towns on their own, only using managers.
That isn't how it was.
I don't talk about abolishing the representatives in my book, they can stay there comfortably.
There question is how many of them there should be.
I don't remember that.
I spoke about direct elections and reducing the number of representatives.
Prague has 1.2 million citizens and 1171 representatives.
The same applies to the government, which has only been governed by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
The current prime minister isn't guiding anything, he only moderates the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to push through the majority system?
It would be ideal, but it is difficult to enforce.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That is certainly not the case.
The French President Macron announced that he was reducing the legislative board by a third, and there are 57,000 French people per one legislator, whereas here the ratio is 17,000 Czechs to one.
Nobody accused Macron of endangering democracy, however.
Even if somebody won the majority vote in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms in place to prevent them from making dramatic changes.
Nothing of the sort applies to the ANO movement.
Why did they vote for me and add 21 percent to GIBS members who already have 60 thousand?
Would you clamp down on that as prime minister?
Ministers are not supposed to argue in the government. Conflicts should be thrown out of it.
The material that comes into the cabinet must be ready. There is no room for coalition ruptures, power ballots and deals. Decisions must be made there.
How do you expect to have a cohesive team when the ministers mainly act on behalf of the party?
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply and turfed Babiš out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
They measure everyone equally and demand perfect execution from one and all.
Do you already know who you would appoint as the Minister of Finance?
I'm not thinking about it at all. We will probably will not end up in government. Nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I do not know what I've done that's so terrible.
So much skepticism is out of place.
I don't think so.
I would leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and ANO Deputy Chairman Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with Tomio Okamura's SPD, such as in terms of the economy, for example.
But he is browned, somehow.
That's not what I'm asking you about at all.
We will not consider cooperating with Mr Okamura's party, I can not imagine it.
I cannot imagine it, but the voters will decide.
Let's go back to your attempt to run the state as a business.
As soon as he did, ČEZ controlled the Czech government.
It's unbelievable that the Prime Minister would send a decree written by ČEZ's management stipulating how the Minister of Finance should vote at the ČEZ General Meeting.
I'm not there yet.
They would like to exchange the hood cooperation with the ČSSD for an even better one with ANO.
I don't know anything about that.
I have no Pokorný or Růžička style lobbyist. I am a separate entity and I do not deal with this at all.
So answer directly.
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
Meanwhile, he has been doing what he wants for years, thanks to kickbacks for traditional political parties.
I don't want to control anyone.
What do you say to the articles describing how, as the first deputy chairman of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek is building a powerhouse by placing his son in the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with municipal and state-owned companies like Pražský dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Company) and České dráhy (Czech Railways) through the lawyer Květoslav Hlína?
I don't like it, and I've reproached him for it several times.
I'm not willing to compromise in that regard.
If anything like that were to happen, we would get rid of the relevant people, no matter who they were.
