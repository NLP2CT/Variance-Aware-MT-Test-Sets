Munich 1856: Four maps that will change your view of the city
It is annoying when geographical maps are not up-to-date.
Anyone who has ever got worked up because the car's sat-nav is showing a green field instead of a bypass knows that.
The historical maps of the digital BayernAtlas, an offering from the State Government's Geoportal Bayern, are anything but up-to-date – and yet it is precisely for this reason that they are so informative.
Then it becomes clear how the towns and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Merkur newspaper have changed since the 19th century.
According to information from the Bavarian Surveying and Mapping Authority, these came into being between 1810 and 1864 and arise out of the first survey of Bavaria.
The comparison of past/present is most impressive taking the example of the state capital.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated on the map from 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as an urban district of Munich 21 years after the map was created.
Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
Around 1856, Untersendling's houses are concentrated along what is today Plinganserstraße, which was first named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a ringleader of the Bavarian farmers' revolt against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, one sees nothing but field – at first sight: upon zooming in, a more detailed small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered plots from the so-called "original record", from which the property tax was derived.
A large green area is apparent to the north of Untersendling.
Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still actually a "Wiese" – a meadow – and not a concrete wasteland.
In the original lay-of-the-land sheet, in the area where today the borough of Au-Haidhausen is, one can make out not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the elevation "Auf der Lüften" – but can actually read in large letters "mental asylum".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, they once imprisoned people with delusions.
The Munich district mental asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" had come to life there in 1858/59.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the practice of chaining up the so-called mad men.
At some point even this capacity was no longer enough – the reason why the district mental asylum in Haar was constructed in 1905.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth centre with training programmes.
To the west lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost, and to the east, residential houses from the 1980s.
Marienplatz was recorded as the "main square" in around 1856, and Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
One big one remains up to this day – at the Marienhof.

Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
Pasture fence project is fundamental
Members of the Bundestag for the CDU Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a first-hand view.
Representatives from the Fischerbach local CDU group met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two representatives at Rechtgrabenhof farm, belonging to the Schwendemann family.
Since he is also BLHV chairman for Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "fundamentally important".
One hopes that with that, afforestation of the area could then be drawn out for a long while.
The Baden-Württemberg directive on countryside conservation (LPR) makes the government funding of pasture fences possible.
Its goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the existence of one of the funding scenarios as outlined by the LPR.
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.

Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."

Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.

Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I'm tired."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
The shootings haven't stopped.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.

Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.

Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel their orders
Musk now concedes that of the 518,000 total pre-orders, 63,000 have already been retracted.
Critics had time and again pointed out that they were only non-binding reservations.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of as of yet 12 per cent of all orders could become a problem.
In 2018 – all models taken together – it is said to be 500,000, and in 2020, a million.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today is looking at delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest – that's if Tesla manages to get its brand-spanking new production lines going, as of yet never tested in practice, without any major interruptions and at maximum capacity.
Should there be major delays, however, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
For the company cannot then prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
Tumlingen is celebrating 750 years of the St. Hilarius Church
750 years of the St. Hilarius Church: To mark the anniversary of the mountain church, invitations are being issued to a serenade in the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday 16th July at 4.30pm.
The St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in records in 1267 in the Württemberg register: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church for Tumlingen on it, together with the Bailiwick" to Master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 silver marks.
According to the text of the official document, aside from the former parish church, a lordly farm also stood on the Tumlingen mountain, which itself owned the church, or the right of patronage, and not the other way around.
The right of patronage arose out of the Early Middle-Age proprietary church law.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or nominate a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower.
During the 30 Years War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed in and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was leaky.
They brought out the pulpit and the pews and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Up until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery in Tumlingen served as the last place of rest for Hörschweiler's dead.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On new year's eve of 1834, a storm cleaved the church tower and half of it collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was pulled down.
It is being arranged by the Kepler Gymnasium, Freudenstadt, combo, with speeches from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Municipal administrator Hartmut Romann gave the closing words.
The serenade will be rounded off with drinks in front of the cemetery.
The serenade will only take place in the case of dry weather.
The organisers are hoping for many backers in favour of preserving the historic St. Hilarius site, which is important to Tumlingen and to Hörschweiler.
Association wants to have wind turbine approval examined
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has called on District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to retract his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Boisheimer Nette.
The association argues that at the time the approval was given on 30th December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in Bosheimer Nette, since at that time only one wind energy concentration zone existed in Viersen, on the city boundary with Schwalmtal.
Construction and operation of wind energy plants are in principle possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time, the concentration zone has an exclusion against the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
The city of Viersen had in fact passed a resolution for a second wind energy concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, through an amendment to the local land-use plan – but the Düsseldorf regional government had not approved it due to a formal error.
"Due to the lack of legal planning requirements, the approval decision that was issued is still unlawful, and should therefore be retracted as well," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich".
The current state of affairs: the city council once again passed a resolution for the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval from the regional government is still pending.
However, it is not expected to lead to a stop in proceedings.
With a view to the proceedings underway at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on Thursday on the content of the arguments put forward by the association "Boisheim wehrt sich".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning construction of four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on a plot by Bosheimer Nette.
The company, in which the city of Viersen holds indirect participating interests, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the roughly 65-hectare site last year already.
The construction of the four wind turbines should cover the energy requirements of around 11,400 households – that equates to around a fifth of the energy requirements of all Viersen households.
Last summer, Viersen city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a share in a wind energy plant in Übachpalenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
A terrible accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10am on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn district).
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to newly discover the shopping opportunities in their town centre in September.
As chairman of the trade association Christian König announced, the "home-town shopping" weekend is meant to make customers aware of what offers their own town has available aside from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with local suppliers is thus planned, similar to the weekly market.
The trade association and the town are thus entering a further stage of the "attractive town centre" project.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
Brigit Streich, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce centre in Mühlhausen communicated that five Thüringen towns are taking part in the nation's third "hometown shopping" day.
Alongside Bad Lagensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The campaign, under the leadership of the Chamber for Industry and Commerce and with many partners, also brings home that all citizens can themselves influence their immediate environment with their shopping behaviour.
During construction works, there was a huge gas explosion in the school building.
According to information from the fire department, one injured person was still in a critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
Someone initially classed as missing was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees at the school.
Being holiday time, only a few people were in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.
Brooks put it more succinctly.
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.
"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" propitiates Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf again focusses on a colourful and frivolous production, set against a giant, six-storey backdrop.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif – gold, power and greed – that runs through his production of the "Ring".
The three Rhinemaidens – sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner – work wonderfully together, as they did already in "Rheingold".
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) cops it too.
The performance from Frank Castorf and his directing team had been awaited with excitement.
Max Menge works as volunteer
How did that come about?
I recognised that it is not right for me and that I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what do you do?
And was it like that?
I will study in dual, probably do an apprenticeship as a welfare worker at the Herne child protective services and study in Hamm at the university of applied sciences.
Is it not somewhat unusual to have several different work locations during the voluntary service?
Whether it's a refugee or an adolescent who has been pulled out of their family – you always have to approach it individually.
Menge: I'm not the kind of guy for that.
It is an area that gives one a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of friendliness.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.
Municipal council wants common room
The decision, which was already pre-determined last Autumn through the allocation of resources for the current budget, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is in an area for redevelopment.
The construction of a common room would be eligible for financial support, reports Tjaden, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
So as to signal to the investor that no-one wants to put a spoke in their wheel, the proposed resolution makes allowances for the determination that both a saddled roof – based on the surrounding buildings – and a mono-pitch roof – which reduces the height of the eaves and makes the building more economical – would be possible.
If it helps: it passes through the committee unanimously.
It's not so easy with the common room.
She views that as a hidden subsidy to already wealthy, or even foreign, investors.
Staiger's proposal, to split up the proposed resolution accordingly, has three supporters.
The 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car whilst crossing the road in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured.
According to police reports, the 82-year-old from Langenfeld was travelling on his bicycle on the Schwarzer Weg cycle lane at around 12.20pm, coming from the direction of Hilden.
A woman driving a car in the same direction gave way to him.
FC Bayern Munich have to do without David Alaba and Thiago for the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup is happening without him: David Alaba has to skip the game against Dortmund.
The squad concerns are getting even bigger for the German football record champions Bayern Munich ahead of the Super Cup on Saturday (8.30pm/ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winners Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to also do without David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed that on Friday.
In addition, the Munich team is missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
Wandering from star to star in the Harz
It is being planned by the Sankt Andreasberg Observatory society.
There has been a planetary trail in Göttingen since 2003.
Members want to set up plaques along the planned route and put information about stars and constellations on them.
In the running are St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber.
So good mobile network reception plays a part in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
In addition, they will learn why stars have different colours, or why one star shines more brightly than another, although it is significantly further away.
It will also teach which constellation a selected star is located in, and when the best time to see it is.
The society has been operating the highest observatory in Northern Germany, in the small mountain town of St. Andreasberg, since 2014 already.
The location in the middle of the Harz national park is among the six darkest regions in Germany, according to information from the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation.
One can regularly clearly see the Milky Way, and even the Andromeda Galaxy, from there with naked eyes.
The Earth thus shrinks to a ball with a diameter of 6.5 millimetres, while the sun, standing exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The trek to the nearest fixed star would take another half a year though.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
Four injured after burst tyre
According to initial reports, the driver of an Opel Zaifra lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30pm, shortly before the Marktbreit junction, after a burst tyre.
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to kick off the season against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defence formation will bring points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was content with the first game of the season, and with the result too, were it not for the two own goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two own goals too many, and in Aue, we have to take better care still," says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
"I don't know yet how we will play in Aue," said the coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoachmann is sure of himself, "because in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, we particularly have players in the back three in the half positions that can build well," said Hoffmann.
"However, if we're standing there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we'll certainly be able to talk of a decent season kick-off."
His coach didn't want to hear any of that.
"I will first judge our start to the season after six to eight matches," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not wish to talk of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxony team's game in Heidenhelm had to be cut-off early due to a storm.
Admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland go into the encounter on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished Aue stadium as slight favourites.
"There is no team in the second Bundesliga that one has to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach.
And Funkel does not under any circumstances want to see his players like that on Sunday.
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
Right on target
On Wednesday, a seven-tonne piece of concrete was installed at the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach.
"We're doing very well for time – it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager at the department of road engineering and transport in the Freiburg local government.
In April, works began on all three bridges in need of refurbishment between Schramberg and Lauterbach at the same time.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It was built in 1900.
What is special about this is that is uses finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
Laying cables through the structure in Lauterbach required particular flair.
Fish and crabs must also be fished out first.
For the construction works on the bridge at the East entrance to the town of Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge, where the "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" hotels are, is fully closed.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest with German potato salad
It doesn't happen that often that parties pull together, but when it concerns the Alternative for Germany (AfD), people come together who would otherwise be difficult to reconcile.
The parties who represent in the Vulkan Eifel district council (CDU, SPD, the Greens, FDP, FWG, die Linke) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully nailing its colours to the mast on this day because the AfD are holding a "big kick-off to the election campaign" in Gerolstein Town Hall plaza.
And are launching famous names – like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland makes up the leading duo for the Bundestag elections on 24th September, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch.
How did the AfD make it to Gerolstein, actually?
And it does: at around 8pm some entertainment is provided, by a band on the plaza forecourt, and in the town hall, by various speakers, including Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 in attendance, waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag elections, Alice Weidel, and the federal deputy chairwoman, Beatrix von Storch, to give their speeches.
Trombone meets trumpet
There is another chance to hear Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli in the series of Haslach cloister concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he is giving a concert that carries the slogan "The Black Sea meets the Black Forest", or even, "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German education with roots in brass music.
So, Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
Despite all that, the brunette actress assures "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I've been deeply in love with everyone I've dated.
I just never liked being made fun of."
When I was eleven, kids told me I looked like a boy.
She particularly doesn't like explaining her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way, and that makes me angry.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the entire public."
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."
Act of mourning for soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a memorial service in the north Hessen town of Fritzlar, around 1000 people commemorated both soldiers who lost their lives in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place in the cathedral city on Thursday under strict security precautions.
German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) remained silent on the as-yet-unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two pilots who were killed as "experts in their field".
"We bow before this greatest of sacrifices that they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
Their coffins were transported back to Germany and on Thursday were brought to Saint Peter's cathedral in Fritzlar, accompanied by a wake from the German army.
Among these were Hesse Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and Inspector General of the German Army, Volker Wieker.
Memorial guests laid down roses, and the relatives stood arm in arm by the coffins.
Defence minister von der Leyen described the killed soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in missions.
The Stabshauptmann is said to have helped set up flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six qualified Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Minister von der Leyen did not express any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous.
After his wife Margrethe's accession to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
My Danish was faltering, I preferred wine to beer, silk socks to wool socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco, and which had the reputation here for being the brand of intellectuals who were critical of society, I could not hope for any leniency.
Prime Minister Weil wants a snap new election
CDU and FDP face possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's prime minister Stephan Weil (SPD) wants the State Parliament to have a snap new election after the loss of the red-green governing majority – but he doesn't want to step down.
Previously, the unexpected resignation of a Green party representative from her state parliamentary fraction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD)'s government into a stark crisis.
"I see my political future in the CDU," she stated on Friday in Hanover.
CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his party to take her in.
However, Stephan Weil considers it imperative that the State Parliament vote to dissolve itself as swiftly as possible.
The state constitution also allows for the possibility that the State Parliament declares no confidence in the Prime Minister and elects a successor.
Thümler called Twesten's move "somewhat curious though".
She described herself as a supporter of Black-Green.
"We naturally assume that she will give up her seat in Parliament, which she won on a Green party ticket, with immediate effect," communicated state chairpersons Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Green Party chairwoman Anja Piel said: "We exceedingly regret Elke Twesten's decision".
SPD candidate for Chancellor Martin Schulz denounced the crossing over of Lower Saxony Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal.
Twesten's resignation costs Red-Green the majority in Lower Saxony.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony plays along in this dirty scheming and attempts to score political points from it."
Lower Saxony CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to advise his representatives to take Elke Twesten into the CDU.
The parliamentary group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Opperman, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the State election in 2013 with her personal career notions.
The CDU was then the strongest power ahead of the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the State Parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in interview – How do we protect ourselves against poisoned eggs, Mr Schmidt?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Food and Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers our questions in interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look very carefully at the eggs in their fridge and check the stamps printed on them.
The federal states are each supplying their most up-to-date information on the affected egg batches on the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Despite that, the ministry immediately connected and has been liaising closely with the state authorities ever since it became known that Germany was affected.
Uncontaminated eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
According to what we currently know, the production facilities are not in any way directly to blame.
As always in emergencies, there are too few inspectors.
It is for precisely this reason that it is so crucially important to have such occurrences thoroughly cleared up and passed over to public prosecutors in cases where crimes could have committed.
Fundamentally the following has to be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the farming of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be ended immediately.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.
The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
Swiss did not wish to make any statements on the costs.
Swiss will not disclose how many bidders there are for the new call for tenders.
However, only Swiss producers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to strive to renew the contract beyond Spring 2018.
Swiss has been handing out chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate bars, in collaboration with Hug.
Track-and-field discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches the World Championship finals
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the finals on Saturday.
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.
It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
The police have delivered a successful blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest-Baar district, numerous properties were searched in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, said the Konstanz public prosecutor's office on Friday.
In addition, officials seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspected Italians.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
In total, over 300 policemen were deployed.
The mafia members were charged with organised drug-related crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.
Konstanz public prosecutor's office has been investigating the drug trade in southern Germany since the summer of 2016 already.
Weise complains of big holes in the Register of Foreign Nationals
Defects in the data registered there could lead to "some grave mistakes in decisions" when it comes to asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis received by the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
In some cases, data from 1921 was found, "from people who have long been dead, or from citizens who became German nationals and actually should no longer be showing up in the register."
This is emerging from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
Second-best result achieved
Altogether, the blood donor service made 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available for others.
At least, from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday.
"It is ingenious how our bodies are designed for this and we show respect to the donors who make their blood available for strangers, and so selflessly," stressed mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the campaigns that are to be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
Already before then, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were numbered amongst the repeat donors and honoured for having made 50 donations each.
Half as many were clocked up by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Reixinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 millilitres of their lifeblood.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.
They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
On Friday, that hope appeared gone.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
As the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is being requested and hoped for.
Police across all of Europe are sending (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Europol reported on Friday about the campaign, which follows on from the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar from the winter.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is being turned into the Waldhotel Luise.
For when the Hotel Birkenhof was closed by former operating company Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13th April 2014, at the time around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost, and with that, the income from the visitors' taxes.
In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who were coming into the rural district, the hotel building was offered to the district administration as collective housing, which sparked controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by preparing development plans to secure the area as a hotel location.
The Luisenhotels Group, with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to being an establishment in the three-stars-or-more category, under the name Waldhotel Luise.
Two of them are in Bad Bergzabern, and one is in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and, now, Waldhotel Luise.
There has been a skip standing in front of the entrance to the former Hotel Birkenhof for a long time now, and when you enter the building, it becomes clear just how extensive the refurbishment works are that are being undertaken.
The floors have been ripped out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bath tubs taken out of the rooms.
Everything is to be redone in the Black Forest style.
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities.
One doesn't want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but still at an elevated downtown level, stressed Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its roughly 60 rooms, wants to set itself up for a broad audience, explains Scherer further.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: US Special Counsel convenes grand jury
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have convened a so-called grand jury, according to one report.
The panel started work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal", relying on sources intimately acquainted with the matter.
US secret service has long been accusing the Kremlin of purposefully interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
According to reports, Mueller has been subjecting Trump's private and business circles to more and more scrutiny.
Grand juries are for this reason also called prosecution chambers.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former campaign manager Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the grand jury is ultimately being engaged in order to decide whether to bring charges.
But it usually operates in secret, he stressed.
There is no reason to presume that anything has changed, his statement continued.
This gave rise to speculations about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators proposed draft legislation on Thursday that would make it no longer so easy for the Special Counsel to be dismissed.
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf.
The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven communicated this on Wednesday.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the last three decades.
The extent to which climate change had a part to play in the iceberg breaking off is unclear from the research scientists' findings.
The now detached colossus was previously a part of the Larsen C ice shelf.
The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America, almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
An entire ice shelf crumbled there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is in danger too, for the front edge has never retreated so far back as it currently is.
What is more, the ice sheet is under tension and could crumble if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of shelf ice and icebergs do not raise sea water levels, since they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it itself produces after melting.
According to information from the AWI, the Larsen C ice shelf, at almost 50,000 square metres, is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica.
"Although this is a natural event, and we’re not aware of any direct link to climate change, this puts the ice sheet in a very vulnerable position," says Martin O'Leary from Britain's Swansea University.
According to data from the research programme the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperatures has contributed to this decline.
Since it is getter ever more difficult to fill the positions that become available, the CDU is calling for secession from the employers' association, so as to become more attractive.
Currently there are 50 positions at the district of Mettmann that are still unfilled.
The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to seize the initiative in the district assembly and counter the dearth of skilled workers in the administration.
The plan is not only to satisfy short-term demand in skilled workers, but, with a view to the future, to counteract the shortage of applicants, it is reported.
The entire concept should focus internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for lateral entry employees, and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
Well that does sound like a good approach.
In addition, a large number of employees are leaving service due to illness or age.
Yet Klaus-Dieter Völker, parliamentary group leader of the CDU, is, with his party, going even beyond the joint request.
Völker wants all avenues to be examined that enable a secession from the municipal employers' association.
"If we don't reach a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should strive with the unions – perhaps also in collaboration with the district's towns – to secure an in-house wage agreement," said Völker.
Yet the district's tasks have expanded more and more in recent years.
Not least because of the growing number of applications for asylum, County Commissioner Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin outpost", and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and attractions.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim's Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.
There followed viewing spots, some on towers, from which one could look far and wide over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
On the second day, they went to Bad Dürkheim, to the salt works and to the Wurstmarkt festival.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in healing salt water in the open-air inhalatorium.
They headed for Neustadt too.
Will the sports stars of the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of battling sweatily, come wind or rain, on the stadium turf?
VfL Wolfsburg took the lead in 2015, followed later by FC Schalke 04, and most recently by VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in the middle of July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.

Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
"She ended his life to better her own.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini Lahm
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to take to the field as captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern thinks the Confederations Cup winner is capable of a big season – a bit of extra motivation doesn't hurt.
But Kimmich could also interpret the signal from the coach as follows.
And anyone chosen to take on the mantel of Lahm can do only too well with a little bit of extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That is what one wants as a player: to take on responsibility."
And in general, Kimmich looked in this starting formation like one who is best able to take to the helm.
He had an eye for the bigger picture while many others were busied with themselves.
Vidal to cover up his lack of fitness (didn't really work); Renato Sanches to live up to his performances of the Asia trip (worked, but to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not make a negative impression on their first outings in the Bayern jersey.
Rudy, for example, gave not one or two, but as many as six or seven interviews in the tunnels.
Kimmich took his leave after a few crisp remarks in support of his new team mates.
There was an interesting sentence to be heard from Süle there: "I've already noticed what went wrong here.

Companies happy with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Industry praises Wissing's speed
The relationship between the state and local industry often proved irreconcilable when Evaline Lemke (The Greens) was still Rhineland Palatinate's Economic Affairs Minister.
This is evident after more than a year of the new Economic Affairs Minister, Volker Wissing (FDP) being in office.
The goal is to put the stretch into service in December 2020, says ministry spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
The Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) is striving, as spurred on by Wissing, to achieve a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the last ten years of sagging German wine exports.
In addition, Wissing is said to have a sympathetic ear for people who want to found their own company, the IHK applauded.
The Trier Chamber of Trades sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus, says manager Matthias Schwalbach.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to employ at the Federal State Office for Mobility, only 29 posts have been filled thus far.
The IHK is pressing for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
They complained about sluggish internet connections and outages.
Ex-Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of wind energy company Pro Wind.
Lemke left the Green party in April in order to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe – from where, after four months, she has already bid a retreat due to disagreements.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.

Provence lavender under threat from climate change
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.
And a lot is at stake.
Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.
The small town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön Mountains is today celebrating its 1200-year anniversary.
The highlight of the festivities will be this Saturday and Sunday, with a Medieval festival.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
He left a wife and two adult children.
But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
According to initial police information, just shy of 30 vehicles, among which were probably also lorries, had crashed into each other during a storm at around 5pm between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (in the rural district of Aichach-Friedberg).
There are mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson.
There was a big squad of rescue vehicles at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
As an AZ journalist reports, there were massive disruptions in the opposite lane as well – due to numerous rubberneckers.
A rescue helicopter was underway to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Company trials "comfort check-in"
Or one is buried deep in one's work and has just had a genius idea.
The conductor comes and rudely awakens you, or tears the passenger from the midst of his workflow.
Deutsche Bahn is currently trialling conductorless ticket inspection.
And you have to have booked an online ticket – which most passengers do already anyway.
In addition, you have to have bought it over the Railway's app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket in any case.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
For "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get on board the train and call up your ticket in "My Tickets".
The trial customers will then see a button for electronic validation.
The train attendants receive a notification on their mobile device saying that passenger X is onboard the train and has occupied booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to seat Y during ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger there with an already validated online ticket.
So you can carry on sleeping, working, doing nothing.
"Anyone who wants to travel in a relaxed fashion, without having his/her ticket inspected by our on-train staff, simply checks in him/herself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to personalise their journey time in the train," says Michael Peterson, Director of Marketing at DB Fernverkehr.
Anyone who travels by train a lot knows that, alongside delays and missing your train, ticket inspection is one of the biggest annoyances.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad atmosphere in the compartment or wider area and delays in one's own ticket getting checked, and ultimately it takes away the conductor's time to see to other matters.
Other train numbers on the same line have not yet been enabled.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss the Bit Galerie
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into those for and against since its first presentation in 2009.
The topic is also being discussed on our Facebook page, "Volksfreund Bitburg".
Whereas some say of the Bit Galerie, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or, "That would be really fantastic" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side we hear, "No-one needs that" (Siggi Betzen) or, put quite bluntly: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
Whilst those in favour count on the gallery drawing more customers into the town, which would benefit the other businesses as well, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be haemorrhaged.
We have also discovered the butcher's for ourselves.
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct sellers settle in a covered market in the gallery depends on the level of the rent.
But that is not exactly likely to be low for the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why a shopping palace in Bitburg?
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least get to keep the covered market.
For after all, the goods on offer there are fresh, are largely offered directly by the producer, and are good value to boot.
As you see, shop premises in shopping centres are only rented by big companies, because the rents there are often not tenable for retail traders.
But there is no space left for a covered market thanks to the crazily large number – as I see it – of pointless construction projects in Bitburg
If the covered market is destroyed, then another piece of culture will disappear."
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"So never shut up."
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
All measures have been implemented.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
This was announced by the corporate group.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
It's pushing 11 p.m. as a throng of UCLA football players linger to chat on one side of the team's new on-campus practice fields.
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crammed schedules.
UCLA will close its practices once camp is finished, no easy task given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
If you have videotape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
"That's his thumbprint!
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
"There is a record of a riot happening at the castle in 1380, in this book called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
Campaign launched: over 300-year-old Lady Chapel in Rhöndorf encased
"Too beautiful for us,
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website, activated yesterday.
In actual fact, we are firmly convinced that we, as residents of Bad Honnef, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our town."
"A stand-alone pledge has to be formulated, one that lends the town an unmistakable unique selling point."
The town of Bad Honnef has given itself a moderate five-figure amount for the costs of its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Every year in Ankara at the beginning of August, the highest military council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So too this week.
The meeting was no longer held in the general staff building as previously, but rather in the Prime Minister's official residence.
Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempt at overthrow as a "gift from God", since it gives him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
There are concerns among the general staff of an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifests itself, among other ways, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the paper.
The big clean-up of the army and the security forces is continuing anyway.
In doing so, it seems as if Erdogan has tamed the military.
Three times they staged a coup, invoking their role as guardians of the secular state order.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer, who sought asylum abroad after the attempted coup out of fear of persecution, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, Nato would not be able to be indifferent to such a development.
In any case, after the purges, there is doubt in the alliance concerning the Turkish army's readiness for action.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have financial resources to support themselves and show skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Minister wants line renovated for Rennsteig shuttle
In order to ensure the long-term future of the Rennsteig shuttle, construction works should begin on the line this year already, according to reports from the Ministry of Transport.
"In taking the decision to continue to commission and to renovate the Ilmnau-Rennsteig line, the state acknowledges that this is an important connection, above all for tourism," stated Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The ministry and Süd-Thüringen Bahn, as operators, are said to already be in agreement over the technical details.
The Rennsteig shuttle should therefore be commissioned as normal from December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a train connection between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig, beloved above all by tourists.
In past months, as part of a pilot operation, there were tests to see whether the line gets used by a large enough number of people for it to continue to be commissioned as normal in the future.
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
The user can also "customise" their robot to suit their persuasions, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour, nipple shape to fingernail type or colour.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicon skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to customise their robots according to the traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
However, these sex robots are not a mere fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
Most men, naturally, are not going to keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they remain, for now, on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But what seeps in from the fringes can be highly instructive as to the tenor of the era we're living in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them the permission to be so.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
But, pointedly, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.
Or to put it into 2017 parlance: handmaidens.
Trump's great feat?
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will merely have to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
So many of the cliches of a city disappoint: views from tall buildings get old, skylines grow too familiar to offer much of a thrill, and the reality of the city doesn't live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
Last year he was taken to the hospital for treatment to cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities said he sustained after falling in his cell.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold found a curious egg
As the last amongst the schools in Blumberg, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were let go for the holidays and sent forth for secondary schools.
Yet hopes of making a chicken out of it were dashed; the eagle spread its wings out on a high mountain and vanished.
The eagle stands for integration, said headteacher Angelika Sitte.
The young animals may well be different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs amongst them.
It is its destiny to be free.
In the end, she was able to depend on the fourth graders.
There are already eight first graders registered for the new school year.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected now need to know
How exactly is the software update taking place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the initiative?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
They are intended to improve exhaust emission properties for cars classed under Euro emissions standard 5, and, some under Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives her assessment:
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered that they be retrofitted.
How and from when are customers being notified of updates?
Daimler has advised those affected to write to them.
It depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure.
It could be more laborious getting an appointment.
What do car drivers do who don't drive a car by BMW, Daimler, Opel or the VW Group?
The ACE advises waiting.
Is there now the threat of a massive price collapse in Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center honours
One of the award winners does not want to come – out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
The awards are handed over at the beginning of December.
For this reason, the award-winner Lear, made famous by a series of TV shows, already announced that he would not be attending the gala.
The 59-year old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
The Kennedy Center, named after former president John F. Kennedy, is the biggest cultural establishment in the US capital.
Roland Wacker, municipal architect in Haslach, is going into retirement next year.
Wacker has been municipal architect for 31 years.
And he still finds the work a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press meeting.
At the same time, it surprises him that up until now no application has satisfied the job profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible opportunity.
As Haslach serves as the lower board of building regulations for the joint association of administrations, applicants have to hold appropriate qualifications.
If it could no longer fulfil it, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
In more than 30 years in office, Wacker has amassed several significant projects that he looks back on with pride.
The latter alone will cost as much as 1.5 million euros "if we do it properly", estimates Wacker.
"All in all, there are great tasks awaiting my successor.
The work here is fun."
There is a lot of scope for creativity for a municipal architect.
With Haslach's own building yard and garden nursery, there is a lot that can be responded too with a high level of flexibility.
In any case, the municipal architect bears a lot of responsibility.
Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the post and wants to stay".
Anyone who wishes to take over from Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, be able to demonstrate completed studies as graduate engineer or a bachelors degree with a specialisation in architecture and should have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building regulations and planning laws.
The municipal planning and building control office is in charge of building construction and civil engineering, urban land-use planning, land acquisition affairs, management of municipal property, the municipal depot with building yard and city nursery, and the lower board of building regulations, including preservation of sites of historic interest.
Bicycle thrown onto cables: southern railway closed
A pink scooter and bicyclist were observed near to the scene of the incident by witnesses.
The perpetrator or perpetrators put themselves and the rail traffic in great danger.
Freight trains were not cancelled, although they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found protein's essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that foster a tolerant gut.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.'
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop in people as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
How the wind changes: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked, with a certain alarm, to Berlin before elections.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt house have been observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year, you couldn't even begin to describe as an opposing wind.
Those were low blows.
And one after the other at that.
After the surprising end to the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general sign of a move away from coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This once again shows that Red-Green simply can't govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green representative plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a stark crisis.
Five months ahead of the state elections, his red-green coalition thus lost their one-vote majority over the opposition made up of CDU and FDP.
The national head of the Greens, Michael Kellner, has called on defecting Green representative in Lower Saxony Elke Twesten to give up her seat.
The cross-over to the CDU represents a clear distortion of the voters' will.
Elke Twesten must immediately give up her seat", said national head and campaign leader for the Greens to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is left without a governing majority after the cross-over of Green representative Elke Twesten to the CDU.
A black eye, no more, his comrades contented themselves at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything was going to be different.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD regional leader, lost his halo that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbe Philharmonic hall while his city was burning.
And because in the crisis talks afterwards, he pretty much did everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And now Stephan Weil too.
Despite that, or perhaps precisely because of that, Weil has been attempting ever more strongly in the last few weeks to make a mark in the federal government.
In actual fact, Weil is not to blame for the Lower Saxony Greens' party-internal strife.
And Schulz is certainly not.
Their anger is directed towards the Greens, and above all, at the defecting parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unacceptable and harmful to democracy how Ms Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the left wing in the SPD parliamentary group, to RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Ms Twesten was voted into parliament not for her person, as a direct candidate, but on a Lower Saxony Green Party ticket, continued the Lower Saxony member of parliament.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, deplored the "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," said Oppermann, who as frontrunner is leading the Lower Saxony SPD into the Bundestag elections, to the RND.
"Now the personal career notions of a future CDU representative is distorting the electoral result," continued Oppermann.
Anyone who wants to renovate their outdated house will soon be able to get support from the state.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives for STEG urban development provided information about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once more cast a glimpse back to what has been the case so far.
Since 1991, there have been regeneration areas in Empfingen.
Back then, in regeneration area I, from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden Württemberg still took on two thirds of the grant amount.
On 4th April, word was received from Karlsruhe regional council that there will be a regeneration area III.
The grant amount is 833,333 euros, of which, 500,000 euros is to come from the federal state, the rest, from the municipality of Emfingen.
How does a regeneration area come about?
If necessary, the area boundaries can also then be shifted again.
The measures would be implemented on a property-specific, that is, per-premises, basis.
The regeneration area would then ultimately be laid down as statute.
Pietzschmann then explained that every community must carry out the aforementioned preliminary studies.
A renovation comment will then be recorded in the land registry for each premises.
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again himself and get an idea of the location, he promised.
That is why there will be surveys, which will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow survey is the "building and property survey", which is about, among other things, the structural condition and the intentions for refurbishment.
It should be noted, however, Gotzel pointed out, that a filled-out survey is not at the same time an application for grant money.
It is not possible to "reserve" grant money for later.
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights around the Washington area and at the South Lawn to practice depositing the President of the United States at the White House with inches of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
TC BW Neuss faces tricky task
Front runner of the second tennis Bundesliga is competing at third-in-table Suchsdorfer SV.
TC Blau-Weiss Neuss is competing tomorrow in Kiel, from 11am, at third-in-table Suchsdorfer SV.

The clock is being turned back in the city's nurseries.
On the 1st September, the city of Krefeld is once more taking the catering in the city's nurseries (Kitas) into its own hands.
"By now, it is not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week that eat in the Kita at lunchtime," explains Pommeranz.
"The workers are assigned to a fixed Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size – there are two-group and seven-group establishments – dictates the number of hours worked.
The cleaning of the nursery rooms – up until now also a task for the kitchen staff – will in future be taken care of by special cleaning personnel.
And that is despite 46 new part-time staff being employed.
"But these hours don't have nearly so much impact for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
To mark 110 years in existence, Kaiseringen Gymnastics Club is inviting people on a small walking tour, followed by coffee and cake.

Men attempt to mug 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from police, the men approached the 13-year-old girl, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstraße, at around 2.55pm, because they wanted to use the girl's mobile to make a phone call.
One of the perpetrators then attempted to snatch the mobile and the girl's necklace, but was unsuccessful.
GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
Scooter knocked over and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately knocked over a scooter parked in the Königsfelder Straße outside residence number 30, thus causing material damage of over 200 euros to the fairing of the vehicle.

Police are seeking witnesses in relation to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese
In the region of the Stolzenau bypass, a passenger car came towards him in his lane, so he had to swerve to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver grazed the crash barrier.
The car suffered material damage.
According to information provided by the victim of the accident, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now appealing for witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the vehicle that caused the accident to get in touch with Stolzenau Police Station via the telephone number 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on cases of abuse exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
That is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen is still causing debate.
After its publication, Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," explained to the German press agency that he was expecting an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedikt XVI.
The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that the coverage was measuring violence at the Domspatzen using "double standards".
With respect to the assaults in Regensburg, no-one doubts that these were "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in future; however, what was striking was the "level of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a totally normal educational tool for dealing with cheeky children, of which I was one."
She thought it unfair to apply current standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
What exactly is in the 440-page report that lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg, has produced?
In total, 547 members of the Regensburger Domspatzen were "highly likely" the victims of assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s, and 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report said of Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, that "in summary, it can be determined that forms of corporal and physical violence were used by the cathedral's Master of Music R. in many cases".
Hesemann explains in the interview why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen exonerates Georg Ratzinger.
For Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of the use of violence against wards at the Regensburger Domspatzen" paints a contradictory picture of the cathedral's Master of Music, Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students stress his "humaneness".
How do you judge this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If one makes the effort and reads the entire 440-page-long report from start to finish, one actually has to ask what the name of Georg Ratzinger is doing in there at all.
The extreme acts of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of activity.
At best, one can accuse him of having found out too late or not having taken the first indications seriously enough.
So, the vast majority of his students gave Georg Ratzinger a quite glowing testimonial, describing him as "warm-hearted", "beloved", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provide the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always mobbed by clusters of children".
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely, appalling sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence at preschool, these are of course mere trifles.
In the media, there was a lot reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger also being accused in the final report of some kind of involvement or complicity in respect of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly not.
How do the Domspatzen schoolboys judge Ratzinger's role in respect of the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: One pupil asked put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case where he of all people (Georg Ratzinger) had had early enough knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrators in question.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger has therefore been absolved of any complicity.
In the media, one read a lot about "extreme acts of violence" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Michael Hesemann: That is indeed the big problem, that in the coverage, everything was mixed up and confounded into a huge melange of sexual abuse and acts of extreme violence and somewhere, in the middle of that, was Georg Ratzinger.
But precisely that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
The whole hideous educational theory of spanking, the cases where boys were downright bullied and maltreated by sadistic teachers, and from which they suffered terribly, all of these took place in the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
There, as the vast majority of witnesses stress, the topic of the "preschool" was taboo.
What was different at the Domspatzen secondary school then?
Michael Hesemann: Discipline still ruled there, sure, but there was no sadistic violence.
And that applies to Georg Ratzinger likewise, in relation to whom the report concludes that "many victims treasured the general humaneness of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate him with positive memories, despite the violence."
So, at best, there remains the accusation of having turned a blind eye.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear about the practices in a school where he did not even work and for which he was not responsible (according to the witness), and then next only in around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger systematically close his ears to the conditions?
That was naturally at a time when there was legal clarity that corporal punishment had long been banned in Bavaria too.
That is simply not true.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis indeed asserts that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to that earlier time.
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk here about "the pitfall of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was despicable at all times, and also not to that which was perpetrated in the preschool in terms of vile acts and violence against innocent children; that of course goes far beyond what was accepted back then.
But at the same time I have to come to the defence of Georg Ratzinger, for all that has nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, slapping around the face and pulling the hair and ears, was widespread in the 1970s.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reflect then in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother, the Pope"?
Did the subject of corporal punishment ever come up?
Nevertheless, I do not at all conceal that he ran a strict regime there.
But this too has to be said: without this perfectionism, without this demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to forge from the Regensburger Domspatzen – up until that point famous rather on a national level – a world-class institution, a cultural ambassador for Europe and its musical tradition, that twice a-piece went on tour to the USA (1983 and 1987) and to Japan (1988 and 1991).
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond that, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really very well, and my experience of him was always as a wonderful, humorous, totally benevolent, deeply devout and good-hearted man, who one cannot imagine would be capable of even hurting a fly.
I regularly hear how many former Domspatzen still today keep in regular contact with him, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him – he is almost blind – and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who up until today still do not forgive him for once being too strict with them are therefore in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are today grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them nearer to the world of music.
And for always being a good, fatherly teacher – a strict father, sure, that may well be – but also a loving person, to be respected, whom they still look up to today and downright worship.
And please, once more, just to be clear: all that he is accused of are methods of education, that back then were order of the day.
But it is highly unjust to make a media scapegoat out of a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind that is all too obvious.
Now one would ask for the decency to finally leave in peace a 93-year-old man who has rendered great service and without whom probably no-one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know of the Regensburger Domspatzen
