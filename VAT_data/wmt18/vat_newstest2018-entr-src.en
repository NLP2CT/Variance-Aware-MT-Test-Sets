Breaking news: Our Cosmic Visitor Huge Asteroid 2014 JO25
Left over from the sun’s formation and having either closed or open orbits, these objects could, at times, cross Earth’s path.
With a diameter of 650 meters, asteroid 2014 JO25 is such a visitor, and today at 14:24 will pass by Earth, at its closest point 1.75 million kilometers away.
For example, last January a bus-sized asteroid passed by within half the distance between the Earth and the Moon (~250,000 km).
Actually, an asteroid of that size would not wipe out your neighborhood, but it’d probably blast out all of the buildings’ windows.
Let’s have a look at a couple of scenarios from the European Space Agency’s simulation.
If such an asteroid collided the with the Earth with the same angle and speed, it would form a crater 600 meters deep and 12 km in diameter.
Tons of objects from space are falling to earth.
Let’s end our article with some other, relaxing news.
According to studies, no asteroid large enough to cause serious destruction is expected to collide with the Earth in the next 300–400 years.

Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Demba Ba is OK at Besiktas
Requesting a comprehensive health report from the Senegalese player, the Black Eagles started moving after the star football player sent his report.
Starting on preparations for the 32 year-old player, of whom his China representative does not consider as part of the roster for the upcoming season, Beşiktaş’ administration knocked on the Shanghai team’s door.
The Senegalese player is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days and sign an official contract.
Castillo has undergone surgery in Trabzonspor
Announcing that he will stay away from the pitch for three to four weeks because of the treatment, it had previously been decided that the Colombian player would undergo surgery for his meniscus problem.
Referendum rebuke by Barzani!
In his speech, touching upon the issue of the independence referendum that the KRG wanted to hold on September 25the, he said "I regretfully report that we have no hope at all that Iraq would every become a proper country."
Reacting to the fact that the Iraqi central government gave no weapons at all for them to fight against the DAESH terrorist group, but rather that all of the weapons were supplied to Hashd Al-Shaabi, which was established quickly following a fatwa, Barzani added
The central government has not provided to Peshmerga what it provided to Hashd Al-Shaabi.
According to the constitution, Peshmerga is accepted as part of Iraq’s defense system.
However, while Hashd Al-Shaabi has no existence in the constitution, by violating the law all means were made available to them.
We are not saying that we are against Hashd Al-Shaabi.
Peshmerga and Hashd Al-Shaabi have fought on the same front, but then why is Hashd Al-Shaabi being legalized, yet Peshmerga’s existence and fight against terrorism is being covered up.
According to a news article published by the BBC, while the North Korean missile was airborne, a Boeing 777 type airliner belonging to Air France was flying over the west of Hokkaido, located to the north of Japan.
An official said that the missile fell on the spot where the airliner had passed only ten minutes earlier and was estimated to have been within 100–150 kilometers of the airliner.
"The information we have at this stage is that the missile fell into the sea more than 100 kilometers from the airliner’s route.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
As for my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."

I have found the answer
Think of a "armchair".... With a budget of 6,867,000,000 Turkish Lira, larger than eleven ministries: Economy; Development; Energy and Natural Resources; Science Industry and Technology; Environment and City Planning; Health; Culture; Tourism!
Yes, I am talking about the Religious Affairs Directorate!
Yes, it is the President of Religious Affairs Directorate Görmez that I will be talking about!
For days... I have been looking for an answer to the question in my head...
I am curious about the real reason for the unseating of Mehmet Görmez...
Mehmet Görmez prepared the Religious Affairs Directorate’s 2017-2021 Strategic Plan.
So, what happened?
First the President of the DİB, M. Rıfat Börekçi, served for seventeen years.
As you all know, Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz occupied the seat for eleven years.
I am getting back to my question: Why did Mehmet Görmez leave his position?
So, Mehmet Görmez was perceived as a reformer.
He lined up to pray with Shia clergy.
The goal of all was to set a path to reach Allah.
In situations where school of thoughts precede the religion, the religion itself was the most damaged...
I would like to reiterate this by underlining:
So...
This is not the Sunni idea, it’s Wahabism
Mehmet Görmez’s trip to Iran and the speech he gave made him the target of the "traditional scholars".
The reason was obvious; "traditional scholars" in the DİB who are anti-Shia/anti-Iran.
The main person responsible for this was the Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş who was in charge of the DİB!
Mehmet Görmez was so suffocated that Görmez demanded that the DİB be subordinated under the Presidency.
At the core of it...
Within the state, There are difference about Sunnism.
"Traditional scholars" whose theoretical worlds were shaped in the madrasahs of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, were unifying Sunni thought with Wahabism-Salafism under the shadow of the USA!
On top of that, via FETÖ plots...
What a coincidence!
The result...
- A modernist... A man of religion was terminated by a group of "traditional scholars", formed with a Cold War era mentality....
Vang said "We hope that Turkey participates more in international issues."
"On the issue of Palestine, we hope that this is resolved through the international community that Turkey is part of" he said.
Ruhani officially starts his second term
In May, having won Iran’s presidential election, Hasan Ruhani’s presidency was approved by the country’s leader, Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
Elected president of Iran for the second time, Hasan Ruhani’s swearing in ceremony was attended by the country’s religious leader Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
Taking office for four more years as president, Ruhani`s position will become official after being sworn in during the oath taking ceremony on Saturday, August 5.
Representing Turkey, the Minister of Economy, Nihat Zeybekçi is expected to participate in the ceremony.
Trucks carrying loads other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine or cleaning materials will not be allowed to pass through the Cilve Gözü Border Gate in the Reyhanlı District of Hatay Province.
However, aid trucks remain allowed to pass through the Cilve Gözü Border Gate.
She rarely even uses a pot.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.
There is no public transport.
The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
"I'm tired."
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
Some never reappear.
Poverty feeds the discontent.
Bread is just as out of reach.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
Good news about social aid for over 4,000 chronic patients
According to reports, following the directives of the Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, it has been confirmed that work has begun on the details and a code of practice for the "New Social Aids Program for Families Fighting with Chronic Diseases".
In addition to the planned provide support at a level of two-thirds of the minimum wage, further payments will be made to tuberculosis patients who are identified by the health unit as being unable to fulfill their medical self-care, who are bedridden, or whose houses or living conditions need to be improved.
More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds
The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.
The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.
People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
China finds US explanations to be positive
In the press conference in their capital city Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi said that they were paying attention to Mr Tillerson’s statement on Pyongyang, and commented "We are not searching for any excuse for regime change, the fall of the regime, a faster re-unification of the peninsular or for sending our soldiers to the north of the thirty-eighth parallel".
Drawing attention to the fact that the security of the Korean Peninsula was their priority, Vang stressed that they expected that through mutual dialogue the sides would find common ground for a solution to their concerns, that the Beijing Administration was insistent on non-proliferation in the Peninsula, the preservation of peace and stability, and the resolution of problems through dialogue and discussion.
He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.
Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
On an annual basis, the largest increase was in the transportation group, with 15.24%.
But, in opposition to the headline, there are increases in core indicators, in comparison to the previous month.
Speaking at the press conference organized after the match, Foda said that Fenerbahçe was a high class team, "we couldn’t use the wings in the first half."
We got a chance for the second goal.
I am proud of my team anyway.

There can be no mention of violence in health at all.
The protest in the hospital garden by health workers was supported by Ankara’s Provincial Health Director Dr. The protest in the hospital garden by health workers was supported by Ankara’s Provincial Health Director Prof. Dr. Oner Odabas, the head of Turkey’s Highly Specialized Training and Research Hospital, Dr. Mustafa Pac, and by patients’ relatives.
Condemning the incident, Mr Pac said:
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is rampant.
After statements were made, the staff continued with their work.
The relatives of a patient who had lost his life in intensive care assaulted the doctor who gave the death announcement, Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Ozbek of the Cardiovascular Surgery department.
One of the doctor witnesses said:
Later we took our friend to the surgery and hid him there.
According to reports, as part of the investigation being conducted by the Gaziantep Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, and as a result of the Gaziantep Security Directorate’s Anti-Terror Branch’s intelligence activities against the armed terror group DAESH, 102 sacks together holding 5,100 kilograms of ammonium nitrate for making explosives were seized in a raid on a Kayaonu Quarter warehouse. The sacks were later confirmed as having belonged to the DAESH terror group.
In addition, four banned books published by the FETO/PDY terrorist group’s media arm were found during the searches.
After their interrogations were completed, the six detained people were passed on to judicial authorities.
The suspects were subsequently arrested by the Criminal Court of Peace to which they had been referred.
US intervened
Civilians running for their lives from the siege of Raqqa by anti-DAESH forces aren’t allowed by the YPG terrorist group to enter cities they control.
Let’s not carry the old world’s fights over into tomorrow
One of the reasons for what we call the "Easterner mentality", how the backward East perceives the world’s realities, could be the obstruction of their reflections on the East’s geography, or it could be that they are presented as post-truth.
Don Quixote, the Oblomov Realities, and the perception of reality or just not perceiving it at all have comprised much of the world of literature’s subject matter.
Or Goncharov’s ‘Oblomov’ who is a lazy spender who thinks that everything will continue just it was while choosing not to see reality.
Madrasah and university, Janissary and the modern army, the encounters of belief with doubt were responsible for a dramatic-content dualism.
Historical artifact operation in Muş Province
In the statement it was said that "As a result of the work carried out, two gold coins, one silver coin, twenty bronze coins, one golden bracelet, two bronze rings, one shattered glass bracelet, four stone objects, eight necklaces, one pink-white colored stone object, one picture frame, twenty-three stone objects of various diameters/sizes/colors, four sharp metal objects, six Arabic books – assumed to be Holy Koran – from some old period in various sizes with worn covers and pages and with some torn pages, one earthenware cover, ten broken stone objects of some old period in various diameters and sizes, and one bronze copper vessel – along with two suspects – were captured."
Turkey wind
The underbidding range for the subsequent auction was set to 0.01 cents.
Groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed in the underbidding.
MingYang-Ilk Insaat took eleven recesses.
Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon Energy consortium took no recesses.
The underbidding auction continued for thirty rounds.
The winner of the strong contest between the two consortia was the Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon joint-venture group, with the lowest bid offer of 3.48 USD cents/Kilowatt-hour.
The two-hour YEKA tender resulted in a world record for Turkey.
Our goals are high.
No matter how many regional crisis occur in the world, this tender makes me feel proud that Turkey is showing that it is the most trustworthy and most investable country in the region and in the world.
Turbines will be built in five designated regions.
The factory will be established twenty-one months after the contract is signed.
The project’s licence’s duration is thirty years.
Kazim Türker, Chairman of Türkerler Construction, one of the companies in the winning consortium, said that there would be around 64% local manufacturing, and 35% of the equipment would be imported. He added "Equipment financing will be undertaken by foreign resources, and we are planning to finance the remainder through local banks".
"We are happy with the result".
In each of five regions, a facility of at least 50 MW will be built, with a total of 1000 MW.
There will be 3,750 jobs, and each year for 10 years, 5 million USD will be spent on R&D.
The electricity generated will meet the needs of around 1.1 million households. Each year, the three billion kWh of electricity energy generated will, on average, deliver a reduction of 1.5 million tonnes in CO2 emissions.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.
Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.
"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He's alarmed, confused.
"No," Greene said through chuckles.
And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
Absolutely no one laughs.
The reenactment ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.
Her voice breaks on every other word.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.
Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
An accident in Mugla Province: Four dead, six injured
According to reports, near Salkim on the Kavaklidere-Yatagan highway, a car bearing the registration plate 48 YS 411 and driven by Adem Saglam collided with another having plate 09 B 1510 and driven by Sinan Kiroglan.
Following a call made to the 112 Emergency Call Center, several medical and rescue teams were sent to the scene.
The injured: Sinan, Senem, Furkan Kiroglan and Adem, Yilmaz and Abdullah Yigit Saglam were cared for at the Mugla Sitki Kocman University Education and Research Hospital, and at the Yucelen Hospital.
According to reports, their injuries continue to be life threatening.

It was reported that the Police would appeal to Hakan’s friends to testify.
Raising eyebrows on the grounds of it’s causing addiction and violence, and last year banned by the Antalya Governorate for those under 15, "Metin2" again drew attention following the 2009 murder of "small hacker", Metin Kang, aged 13.
To become stronger, players buy characters.
Burying their child the day following the July 25 incident in Koknar Street of Esenyurt’s Istiklal Quarter, the family repeated its allegation that a murder had taken place.
The father, Mehmet Ekinci, said "His ultimate dream was to be a medical doctor. We don’t think that he could have hurt himself or others because of a game". He added "They wrapped an elastic bandage around his neck and tied a knot on the side."
That’s how my son was found.
In no way do we think that our son could have hurt himself, or others, or have committed suicide because of a game that he played over internet.
Let’s say he’d get a little bored and just leave the game.
When his older brother came in there was only one chair.

Borsa Istanbul’s 8-month revenue reaches 50%
The BIST 100 Index sustained an increasing trend that started in December 2016, and in July continued its eighth successive increasing month.
With its performance from the beginning of the year, leaving behind the world’s leading stock exchange markets such as Germany, the US, the UK and Japan, the BIST 100 Index didn’t lose its leader status in July.
The last one was when between December 2006 and July 2007 it had closed the period with eight successive months of appreciation. The BIST 100 Index recorded an increase of 38.3% over that period.
In a statement made to an AA reporter, Mekra Investment Research’s Director, Eren Can Ümüt, confirmed that the BIST 100 Index had continued its increase for eight months and that the increase had exceeded 37% since the beginning of the year.
Funds, especially those looking for high returns, prefer countries yielding high interest rates.
Thus, share indexes with risky asset statuses are in demand.
At the same time, the S&P 500 Index in the US has been recording an increase close to 11% since the beginning of the year, and almost every other week we see new record levels being tested.
Saying that the US President Donald Trump’s inability to cancel health reform, known as ‘Obamacare’, had strengthened the perception that he would not be able to fulfill his expansionary fiscal policies, he said "Although the expectations of a faster growing US economy because of Trump had positively affected the stock exchange markets for a period, the promises not being realized, the FED’s and in this context the market’s hand will be strengthened due to responses indicating faster growth and faster inflation" Ümüt added.
Discussing how technically testing new record levels at 108,600, the BIST 100 Index recorded small profit growth, Ümüt commented
Especially the 109,500–110,000 region is a critical threshold in the short term.
Pointing to the fact that both the FED’s and the European Central Bank’s (ECB) decisions would be the focal point of the global market, Ümüt said that the expectations on FED were already known, but that although no interest rate increase is expected in the September FOMC, the possibility of a balance sheet reduction being enacted might trigger a strengthening of the US dollar.
Saying that, in regards to potential adjustment movements in the index over the upcoming period, the supported region of 104,150--104,600 corresponding to the increasing trend from the beginning of the year, and a 200-hour moving average, were both very critical, Gürcan stated that, if this support region is broken out of, the adjustment movement could continue to the levels of 101,700, to 100,000, and to 99,200 in turn.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast

The Qatari Minister of the Economy and Trade, Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani, said that he wanted to extend his gratitude to the people of Turkey.
The Qatari economy proved its resistance.

Cost of recent natural disasters is 300 million TL
"The damage to the average residential premise following the earthquake is around 6,000 TL".
Stressing the sector’s efforts to compensate for the economic loss, Çağlar said that three our of every four people did not have home insurance, one out of every two businesses did not have fire insurance, and that two out of three people did not have comprehensive insurance coverage. He added that "because of climate change, the risk of natural disasters is increasing."
The entirety of these costs should not be left to the state alone.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as they are thought to be, and the insurance business is not a sector that only pays for damage. It also, at the same time, performs a risk management consultancy service.
"Comprehensive insurance general conditions state that the insured should report their damages within 5 working days and this duration expired yesterday." said Mr Çağlar.
In response to the question "Will the insured be victimized?" he said: "Although under general conditions such a duration is short, the positive prescription period under Commercial Law is two years."
Ina period of problems in the Turkey – Germany relationship, that a German firm, Siemens, won Turkey’s first Wind Energy Renewable Resource Fields (YEKA) drew attention.
"Opened to create a 1,000 Megawatt wind energy capacity, the Wind Energy Renewable Resource Fields (YEKA) tender is first of its kind" it wrote, reporting that the number of firms competing in the tender dropped from eight to down to two, with the Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortia competing, with the Chinese Mingyang consortium withdrawing from the tender in the thirtieth round.
No matter how many regional crisis occur in the world, this tender makes me feel proud that Turkey is showing that it is the most trustworthy and most investable country in the region and in the world.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.

New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.

West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.

Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.

TYDTA Chairman Ermut: Foreign direct investment will exceed last year’s.
TYDTA Chairman, Arda Ermut, has indicated that 55% of all investment last year came after July.
"We are hoping for more" he said.
Reiterating that, normally, until 2010, 75% of direct investment came from Europe, Ermut continued
Still, Asia’s share went up from 2% to 7–8%.
Turkey has relations with all of them; Saudi Arabia and Qatar especially are two important actors.
On the contrary, upon even the tiniest of their problems, they will come to us and we will resolve it.
"We definitely won’t let them suffer" said Ermut, adding that they continued to support all investors with confidence.
Ermut said "We can also give an assurance of this for the upcoming period."
Commenting on the events of the past 2–3 weeks, that there was a good lesson to be learned, Ermut said
Germany is an important trade partner of ours and will remain a significant investor.
That is because they already have several investments.
Therefore, there is a bit of a slow down in the processes, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region.
"In the negative sense of the meaning, we have no Saudi investor saying "I see some uncertainty because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, hence I am exiting the market".
While normally hoping for a multiplier effect, this could be a little bit more limited, Ermut said that they had had an increase of 11% in the first five months and that this could be preserved, "God Willing, if there are no such negative developments, one way or another, I definitely believe that we will close this year much better than last year".

How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.
Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
Incurring a loss of 2.35 billion TL in 2015, the sector recorded a loss of only 19 million TL in 2016.
Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Gunes Sigorta are trading on Borsa Istanbul.
Speaking at the TSB’s meeting at which the results of the first six months of 2017 were assessed, Çağlar said that the loss in vehicle insurance totaled 7.3 billion TL over eleven years and that, with the implementation of the premium cap, they estimated the sector’s losses could rise to 2.3 billion TL and that this year the estimated loss ratio will increase to 125%.
Çağlar continued, saying
We have no expectation of profit from our vehicular arm but, when we look at the past eleven years, we could not point to one year in which we made profit.
"However, the Treasury looks at the overall situation, and the Treasury will have the last word as to when this will happen".
The premium for those insured will be set by the Treasury Undersecretariat.
How much longer could the sector bear this loss?" bear this loss?"
Mentioning that the combined capital of all of the sector’s companies was 9 billion TL and, when they incurred a loss of 2.3 billion TL in the vehicular branch, the sector’s capital would be exhausted in three years, Çağlar added "Foreigners are asking ‘Why do good drivers finance bad drivers; why do my thousands of shareholders finance bad drivers in Turkey?’ ."
"At this point, we are trying to explain ourselves to the Treasury" he said
On the question of whether foreigners would reduce their proportional weight in the Turkish insurance sector, Çağlar said "They are not there, yet."
Because of this, they have not given up.
According to the TSB’s data, the sector’s premium generation was 40.5 billion TL in 2016, and in the first half of the year 23.1 billion TL was realized, an increase of 12%.
Starting work on the directives of the Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, the details and the code of practice for the "New Social Aid for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases Program" have been confirmed.
In addition to providing patients with support at two-thirds of the minimum wage, a regular psycho-social support service will also be provided.
The Chairman of the Prime Minister’s Turkey Investment Support and Promotion Agency, Arda Ermut, commented that German companies in Turkey were considered to be the same as a Turkish company, and that political tensions between the two countries was not reflected in the business world.
Ermut said "Approximately 10% of the projects in our portfolio belong to German companies."
Ermut depicted the Abraaj Group’s entering into a partnership with the logistics company Netlog as a good example of this.

In the announcement made on the club’s website, with a transfer fee of 222 million Euro making him the world’s most expensive football player, it was reported that the twenty-five year old Neymar had signed a contract that would bind him to PSG until June 30, 2022.

Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the core stories are the same.

In fact, if you remember, Gülen took a step further and in one of his ‘sermons’ last year praised the Crusaders’ attacks, still a fresh wound in our history: "The Crusaders’ invasion of your country was not so dangerous.
Because, between you and them are red lines.
In summary, it is possible to trace back the motivations of structures such as FETÖ or Tahirul Qadri to the Qadiyanis, to the point of origin, and that all of these organizations support them for spoiling societies so that they can approve imperialism and serve colonialism.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.

Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.
It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.

Wedding ceremony photos of celebrity couples
After four years of ups and downs in their relationship, fashion model Cagla Sike married pop singer Emre Altug in Sortie.
Claimed by the couple to be "our lives’ most special moment", it was immortalized in photographs.
Seven years later the couple decided to get divorced.
Brothers fight over $500 million property empire
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.
Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Using a custom template he exposed crypto FETÖ members
It was later uncovered that FETÖ was behind it and the alleged crime was their plot.
Expelled from the TSK for their FETÖ connections were former Air Pilot Staff Colonel, Hakan Dinç, for issuing a complaint against Yaycı for libel, Adana İncirlik 10th Tanker Base Commander, Air Pilot Air Commodore Bekir Ercan Van, for converting a memo into a complaint document,
Some of the organization’s members, including FETÖ fugitive Tuncay Opçin, had targeted Yaycı with material they had shared on social media before and after July 15.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.'
I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'

This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'
In the statement, it was also announced that from 15 June 2019 onwards the player could unilaterally terminate the contract for 18 million Euro.
Last day’s rush!
They rushed into the fire departments
Last Thursday, thousands of vehicles were damaged after the storm and the hail hit Istanbul.
The drivers first had the fire station’s officers take photos of their vehicles for a damage assessment.
There was a crowd when I came in.
"There was damage to the windscreen" he said.
We queued up.
We had the photos taken.
Making walls between the sea and the land, high-rise buildings don’t let us breathe
The base rock is 25–30 meters below the surface, and the piles have not been dug to that depth.
Weaving a wall between the sea and the land along İstanbul’s Ataköy sea side, the high-rise hotels and residences have left the district breathless.
The CHP’s Bakırköy Municipality Councilor, Nadir Ataman, reacted to the huge shopping mall, hotel and residence projects rising one after another in the district.
Drawing attention to the buildings along the sea side, blocking the wind, Ataman said "Those who eighty years ago planned according to the wind created the Atatürk Forest in Florya.
"The district cannot breathe" he said.
Winds don’t enter the district.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Last minute fist!
Joining the event and having drunk an excessive amount of alcohol, a Russian participant attacked the Russian NTV’s correspondent Nikita Razvozjayev who was broadcasting live.
Reported to be a former paratrooper, the drunken man punched the correspondent with a hard fist.
Stumbling from the punch, she tried to get away from the man.
Following the cabinet changes made by the government, the first session of the EKK met under Simsek at 18:30 in Cankaya Mansion.
Turkey’s macroeconomic outlook was to be discussed during the meeting.
The meeting, under Simsek’s lead, was attended by the Minister for the Economy Mr Naci Agbal, the Minister for Science, Industry and Technology Mr Faruk Ozlu, the Minister for Labour and Social Security Mr Julide Sarieroglu, the Minister of Customs and Trade Mr Bulent Tufenkci, the Minister of Development Mr Lutfi Elvan, the Treasury Undersecretary Mr Osman Celik, the Chairman of the Central Bank Mr Murat Cetinkaya, and other related bureaucrats.
Pointing out that today’s risk minimizing ’fully closed herniated disc surgery’ offers an opportunity to reduce the worries of those patients who had had no success with invasive methods, Mr Karaeminogullari explained how a herniated disc can be fixed in 45 minutes:
In fully closed herniated disc surgery, however, those risks are absent because the surrounding tissues are protected.
Full closed herniated disc surgery takes only 45 minutes.
The special commission at work
The commission will hold a hearing into the CHP MPs Mehmet Gokdag, Cemal Okan Yuksel, Baris Yarkadas and into the High Disciplinary Board Member Turan Aydogan.
It was noted that "Our MP Mr Enis Berberoglu has not requested any special status while holding his parliamentary post, has not sought refuge under the immunity that his status as an MP provided, and has wanted to preserve his belief in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary".
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
She has not accepted responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."
"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
The case has divided legal opinion.
In his statement, Simsek stated that inflation in Turkey should come down to single digits and that food inflation constituted a "risk area".
Deputy Prime Minister forecast that the inflation would sink beneath 7% during 2018.
In his speech, Simsek said
There is no political uncertainty.
Therefore, the coming twelve months will be critical.
Whether we wanted it or not, many of our classical markets have collapsed.
We didn’t just lose a market, we are up against an immigration wave of over 3.5 million.
If I said that our pension companies do not strive enough, I believe that it would be reasonable.
Why?
Because we have taken precautions.
The companies have to neither exert any efforts nor incur expenditures.
To begin with, there will be a performance increase, in addition to the 25% that the state is giving.
When we look at the big picture, I think that interest in it will increase.
Because they will see the performances.
We restructured BES in 2013.
We are working on the right to opt out.
We will look into it, we are working on it.
Maybe citizens will see the returns, see the accumulations and remain in the system.
What would you do?
You’d leave automatic enrollment.
For one thing, the system is functional.
They increased the premiums very quickly.
When we asked what was happening, they said that the judiciary’s decisions do not take into consideration the current regulations.
We have issued new, clear regulations.
And you do your part, we said.
And we said that it could not happen like that.
We have a difference of opinion here.
We have issued new regulations.
We created a pool of risky insured.
Let me tell you this and repeat it.
I would prefer this system to operate on the basis of competition.
That is to say, I do not find the price cap implementations correct: they were forced on us.
SABAH’s headline saved her leg
One of these women is thirty-six year old Mehtap Dursun.
Two years ago her pains began, reaching chronic levels on the sole of her foot.
One of her friends recommended Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
He showed her SABAH’s headline ‘The Azerbaijan’s State of Emergency Minister’s life saved’.
Going to Kalko, he found that Dursun was fighting Buerger disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko gave the young woman urgent surgery.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
Diving into water ranks fourth in the causes of spinal injuries.
"No matter how well one dives, there still could be a serious injury" he said.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar continued:
A place that looks deep to you might be shallow.
The neck must be kept stable, not be moved, and to the extent possible held in place by a hard collar.
The vertebrate of the neck may have been fractured.
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape constantly shifts.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a wrenching decision.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.
It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.
Because of aging, smoking, scratches in the dentin, or the drinking of caustic or dark colored drinks, the teeth tend to become darker over the years.
Whitening of the teeth can be attained by the chemical materials applied by dentists or by porcelain surfaces stuck onto the teeth’s surfaces in the same way as nail extensions.

A "Seniority" issue in the Turkish army
Dear readers, during the Supreme Military Council held the day before yesterday, interesting decisions were taken, especially from the perspective of the Turkish Naval Forces.
So, how did this happen?
Now the order for the commandership was due for only remaining full admiral, that is Veysel Kösele.
But, the government did not want him.
I am trying to explain briefly, starting from the top, how the number 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 commanders in the Naval Forces were not promoted.
The government appointed Vice-admiral Adnan Özbal, sixth in rank, to the position.
A senior is subordinated to the junior one.
I wonder what will happen next?
He won’t and can’t take orders from him.
There is definitely politics in this and we cannot know what is behind the scenes.
Not just as a rank.
For example, an officer finishing tenth in rank in the Military Academy is more senior than the one finishing eleventh.
The commander of the Western Front İsmet Paşa...
He was offered the army commandership, but he said "İsmet is junior to me, I cannot go under his command".
Another is Yakup Şevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Atatürk’s instructor from the Military Academy...
On his return to the country, he was also unwilling to taking take the army’s commandership, uttering the same words: "The commander of the western front is junior to me, and I cannot take orders from him".
The third one has a very colorful name...
Ali İhsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A talkative, continuously criticizing soldier.
The seniority issue in the Turkish army is not only an issue at war, but also in peace.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Kyrie Irving: The world’s not round, but flat!
The world is flat.
This is crazy.
The world is flat?
I think you should research this issue.
I’m telling you, they are lying to our faces.
They are lying to us! he said.
I was also thought that the world was round and that it was revolving around itself.
Do you really think that we are revolving in a solar system?
Not returning!
The information they feed us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You should only seek this truth.
"Do you understand what I am saying?" he said.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.
That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.
When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
The Italian government has prepared a code of conduct comprising of thirteen articles that such organizations should abide by, and it has required them to sign it.
Breaking news: The Banli’s 5 kiosk shop was sealed off after his assault on Buyukersen
Being detained by the police and later arrested by the court to which he was referred following the assault on the Eskisehir Metropolitan Municipality’s Mayor Yilmaz Buyukersen, the retired police officer Mahfuz Banli’s Five Kiosk shop rented from the TCDD was closed and sealed off by the Tepebasi Municipality.
"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko
The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
All measures have been implemented.
Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.

Galatasaray’s President will not return empty handed
Galatasaray’s former president, Faruk Süren, had some hard words for the current president, Dursun Özbek, as the later traveled to Bucharest to convince Mircea Lucescu, and to Ankara to obtain Ndiaye’s transfer.
Here is the special statement of the legendary president for SABAH readers:
The football player comes to the President.
But, whoever is the player, the president does not go to him.
You are giving 9 million Euro for a player that Osmanlıspor purchased for 300,000 Euro...
I won’t remain 7.5 million, it will be 9 million with bonuses!
Galatasaray’s values are being eroded.
And the ones to change this are the Council Board and the General Assembly.
But I understand that the members are happy about this!
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."
Some have peeled off their jersey tops, revealing backs slick with sweat from the toil of the first day of training camp.
For a good chunk of the team, these idle minutes constitute a midday break.
"And they've just pushed through it; they grind, they're great kids.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"That is a real concern and it's not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room and sit up there and videotape a practice.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
She added that Facebook would keep testing its "related article" feature and work on other changes to its news feed to cut down on false news.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
It is not Rhodes's first book based on an archive: he also wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"That's his thumbprint!
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
Then at night, he'd "drink whiskey and get writing."
Just let it go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping-off point to delve more broadly into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 Peasants' Revolt.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
Different generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a knack for wooing heiresses."
He has completed a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"
Buyukataman continued
The lying has become gigantic and the deception has gone deeper in newspapers’ editorial columns.
Characterizing the resignations as "so-called", Buyuktataman said that again the public is being mislead by "so-called" polls and attempted perception management.
Commenting on how important and indispensable an actor the MHP is in Turkish politics, MHP Secretary General Buyukataman said on the resignations:
Saying that "traitors on a leash will go mad and burn to ashes in the fire of factionalism", the MHP’s Buyukataman grouped all the opposition parties and terror groups together, claiming that "From the CHP to the HDP to the Perincek group, from the PKK to FETO, whoever does whatever deed, the Turkish nation’s determination to define its own destiny will never be plotted against."
We have resisted the plans, the new tactics and the plots of a MHP without Turkes, and of a Turkey without the MHP. We have fought to the end against those who want a government without the MHP, a parliament without the MHP.

The THY’s great convenience for families with babies
According to a statement made by the THY Office of Press Counselor, the national airliner continues to develop new ideas for an excellent travel experience, prioritizing the flight comfort of its passengers and working to make them feel more relaxed during their flight.
Prepared in a custom-designed bag, the kit includes a diaper changing pad, disposable baby bibs, a rash cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton wipes, and a chest pad.
The products, none of which contain paraben, alcohol, dyes or harmful chemicals, were each manufactured taking into consideration babies’ skin sensitivities.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There is going to be new US immigration plan to modify Green Card rules, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
The draft law is due to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
Columnists commented on the Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
Thirty years ago we gave Atom Ant’s royalty to Rıza Çalımbay.
If he can handle it, it would be the most appropriate comment for the French player.
Alper’s playing at the front, staying in the second striker’s position left Sturm Graz team "stranded" on the field for long periods of time.
They control the ball but then cannot generate any effective passes in the opponent’s penalty area.
This outlook might bring about the comment a "center-forward is needed", but hesitating to pass to Ahmethan, we are up against a game that cannot get its only center-forward into position.
After getting to a score of 1-1, they could not then benefit from two clear opportunities.
Getting through the tour was important but, applauding the player’s fight, it would have benefited the night much more if they could have raised these fans for "goal".
You can clearly see that every player on the field improved in self-confidence.
For a new page, more of last night’s applause is needed.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Yep.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye colour, nipple shape and fingernail type.
"People snigger about them, but the companies are actually shipping quite a lot and we are going to see them a lot more," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
But it gets even more disturbing, with many of the robots possessing "personalities" that would make a Stepford Wife look progressive.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality toward a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional add-on.
They are pleasant slaves, in other words.
The injured have no life-threatening conditions.
Trump's great feat?
Making Mitt Romney seem the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarised the US electorate have, on a micro-scale, torn families apart.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly straining to burst our filter bubbles.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
While my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels run by the New York parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't require caffeine.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks, but thankfully nobody asked.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this for buying something over the counter.
Having one of the hottest days of the season, people poured onto the Munzur beaches in Tunceli.
Coming from Germany, Hasan Ulu said that they chose Munzur River instead of coastal Cesme or Bodrum and that they are not regretting their decision.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his Pretoria home.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
Pistorius faces having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.

Last words: "I think I am dying, farewell mom"
Expressing her love, she said "I don’t want to die Mom, this isn’t fair. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me, farewell".
Among the dozens who have not been heard from after the fire is 26 year old Italian citizen, Gloria Trevisan, and her boyfriend, who together lived in the twenty-third storey of the twenty-four storey building.
The Trevisan family’s lawyer, Maria Cristina Sandri, a resident of northern Italy, announced in a statement that, according to information obtained from the UK authorities, it has been confirmed that the two young people lost their lives.
I think I am dying, farewell mom
We are stranded, we can’t go out.
Mom, my whole life is flashing before my eyes.
I think I’m dying.
I’m sorry I won’t be able to hug you.
Thank you for everything you have done for me, farewell Mom.
I am going to heaven and I’ll help you from there.
This is the Italian government’s mistake
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments it was found a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells' appearance.
Professor Colonna said: 'We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live within the gastrointestinal tract.
Mice reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted another three signings but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of delivering three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."

White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump drew scrutiny in February when the presidential airplane taxied to the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is flush with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft.
The flight for the Made in America event counted toward the aircrew's training requirement for the month, an official said.
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.

Afghan democracy depends on political role for women, U.N. says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections take place April 5.
This year's elections mark the first time power is handed peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million total registered voters.

GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, a crucial pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago at which a number of issues were discussed openly.

La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they'll face consequences."
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.
Considering both that the victim withdrew his complaint and the way in which the crime was committed, the defendant Gülşen received a fine of 7,000 Turkish Lira for ‘insulting a public officer because of his duties’, while Yılmaz, however, was sentenced to one year imprisonment for the crime of ‘resisting so as to prevent the performance of duties’, taking into account that the victim’s duty was of crucial importance at the crime’s specific date and time, and for the future of the public and of Turkey.
The court board ruled the punishment of imprisonment be converted into a fine of 6,000 Turkish Lira.
After the two defendants had had their fines imposed upon them, the defendants’ lawyers made a request for appeal.
The file then came to the Istanbul Regional Court of Justice of Twenty-third Penal Chamber for

Soldier’s pump-action shotgun turns sendoff into terror: Five-year old Yildizsu could lose her eyesight
According to allegations, M.K. and O.A. from the group had from time to time shot in the air with pump-action shotguns.
The group started dispersing after the sending-off ceremony.
M.K. fired a single shot into the ground with pump-action shotgun while passing by a playground full of children.
Ferhat Turan, Ercan Turan, Kader Balkir, Yildizsu Unus and Inci Kaya were injured and taken to nearby hospitals by ambulance.
She said that the incident took place while her granddaughter was on her lap, "The soldiers’ sendoff celebration started at 8 O’Clock."
It continued for two hours.
The youths started dispersing.
Just at that moment a gun was fired, it happened right in front of me.
My granddaughter’s situation is not good.
We talked to the doctor and this is what he said.
They extracted one of the buckshot while the other remained in her eye.
"She has had surgery and might undergo ten operations.
