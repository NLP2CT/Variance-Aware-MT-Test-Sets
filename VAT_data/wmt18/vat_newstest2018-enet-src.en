Four members of the Kemerovo group arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, police in Spain have arrested Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world by the name of Slava Kemerovsky.
In the Mijas province of Malaga in Spain, the alleged boss of a criminal organization was detained.
Three men were detained as suspects in Estonia; according to the gathered evidence, one of them is a leading figure of a criminal organization and two of them are members of a criminal organization.
The objective of the criminal organizations activity was to commit to drug crimes, and thereby earn criminal gains,” commented the head of pretrial proceedings in the criminal case, public prosecutor Vahur Verte.
Head of the central criminal police division Ago Leis said that the arrests were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted almost a year a half.
For years now, we have had good contacts and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil guard forces.
The information gathered to this point shows unequivocally that if they remained at liberty, the men named in the complaint could continue committing new crimes, which is why the prosecutor’s office sought their arrests and the court approved it as well.
A man arrested in Spain now faces extradition to Estonia.
The pretrial proceedings in the criminal case are being conducted by the criminal police’s organized crime office and headed by the public prosecutor’s office.
In 2005, Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of last decade, he was considered to rank second in the Estonian criminal world after the underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Joint international operations, confiscation of criminal gains, and court decisions handed down all confirmed that the fight against organized crime is effective.
For example the latest court decisions, the eight accused to be tried separately from the so-called Dikajev crime organization criminal case, from whom 80,000 euros was confiscated, or the court decision with regard to nine persons accusing Igor Aleynikov of establishing in 2006 a crime organization engaged in illegal trade in contraband cigarettes and commission of crimes related to human smuggling in Ida-Viru County and southern Estonia.
The amount of criminal gains confiscated in that case was close to 71,500 euros.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Health Board epidemiology advisor Kuulo Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation – fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, greyish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowness of skin and mucous membranes.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us through eating of contaminated food or drinking of water, during sex, contact between hands and faeces from infected people and from hands to food, surfaces, objects, through contact with the mouth, and drug use.
Infection can be prevented through vaccination. Above all, vaccination is recommended for people who travel often and people in the hepatitis A risk group.
Hepatitis B viruses spread through contact with the blood from a sick person, drug injecting, tattooing, piercing, use of everyday items contaminated with blood (toothbrushes, shaving accessories), donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from mother infected with hepatitis to a foetus/newborn.
Among the risk group for hepatitis B infection are drug abusers, sex partners of infected persons, men who have sex with men, infected mother to a newborn, family members and caregivers of the sick, healthcare, rescue and police workers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis B.
Other ways of preventing hepatitis B are: refraining from sharing personal hygiene and manicure accessories, other objects with blades and syringes and needles, refraining from tattooing and piercing, and using a condom during sex with the risk of infection or sexual abstinence.
Hepatitis C viruses spread from exposure to the blood of a sick person, drug injecting, tattooing, piercing, use of everyday items contaminated with blood, donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis and from a mother sick with hepatitis to foetus/newborn.
Among the risk group for hepatitis B infection are injecting drug abusers, sex partners of infected persons, men who have sex with men, an infected mother to newborn, family members and caregivers of the sick, healthcare, rescue and police workers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, people infected with HIV, and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis C.
Preventive measures for hepatitis C are: refraining from sharing personal hygiene and manicure accessories, other objects with blades and syringes and needles, refraining from tattooing and piercing; and using a condom during sex with the risk of infection or sexual abstinence.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic carriers of hepatitis D virus and people who lack immunity to hepatitis B.
Having them with me on the track was amazing,” Farah told the journalists.
Right now, it’s as if two books were inside one cover: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer depicted in his painting The Lady in Gold and a much larger and more sweeping history book of distinguished Jewish families and the German occupation and its aftereffects in Austria.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
At the turn of the century, one in ten Vienna residents was Jewish.
Adele’s parents as well were newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married a Czech sugar magnate twice her age, Ferdinand Bloch, and posed for the Klimt’s famous paintings, her father’s bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adele was not drawn by the whole glamorous life she was a part of.
As to Adele, the only thing known for certain is that the close bond that developed between the model and the artist during the painting process persisted until the end of their lives.
The similarity between the two women was not overlooked by art historians of course.
How is Hitler tied in to the story?
“I think that in memory of my friend Klimt, I am in his debt that I should make his handiwork accessible to the public;” Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of Belvedere Museum a few years after the demise of the artist (Klimt died in February 1918) and expressed the wish that their family’s Klimt collection pass to the museum.
In any case, the function of the Austrian Gallery mentioned in Maria’s will had changed markedly by 1939 – it was no important to find works from among Vienna’s richly endowed Jewish art collections that were to the liking of the Nazi Party.
Some of the works in Adele’s home were suitable for Hitler’s personal art treasury, but not those of Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art heists, a 10-year-long court dispute between the Austrian government and the successors of the Bloch-Bauers began.
Thus it is not so much a portrait but more of a story of the fate of a family – and a very moving story at that.
In the preliminary heat, Gold was very close to her personal record in the 200 m backstroke, with a time of 2:16.62.
Gold got the last, 10th berth in the A final.
In the final, she covered the distance in a time of 2:15.76 for a solid seventh place with a new imposing personal best.
In Estonia’s all-time rankings, Gold rose to third and her latest personal best is the fifth all-time Estonian result.
At the adult championships of Canada, the young future hopeful will also start in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and 200 m and 400 m medleys.
She won a silver medal in the 200 m freestyle with a time of 2:03.22.
The last time the distance was swum so fast by an Estonian woman was in 2008.
Only the record-setting Estonian Elina Partõka has swum the distance faster than Gold.
The Estonian living in Canada also won a bronze in the 100 m freestyle with a superb personal best and a new Estonian season high mark of 56.66.
Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than her, has swum the distance just one hundredth of a second faster.
She also set a person best in the 100 m backstroke relay, with a time of 1.03.69 as the starting swimmer.
In the event twice that distance, she only managed seventh, with a time of 2.17.31 in the final.
Gold currently has the season’s best Estonian time in four different distances.
Donald Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen their teeth
Vacation season is here, which means relaxation for US President Donald Trump as well.
As Trump is one of the presidents who has taken the most days of holiday, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
Although the president’s holiday started yesterday, Trump’s opponents have been speaking out on the topic of the vacation for about a week now.
The now president wrote on Twitter back then: While Obama vacations, golfs, attends parties & jazz concerts, ISIS is chopping heads off of journalists."
It is being official called a working vacation instead, during which Trump will have no time to read or other favourite activities.
In addition, there was said to be another reason for the working vacation.
“I don’t think any of you would like to be in the West Wing in an August D.C. summer day when it’s over 100 degrees with no air conditioning,” said White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue working during his vacation.
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
Polygamy is common here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
There is no public transport.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds the discontent.
Bread is just as out of reach.
Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.
What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.

Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."

Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
It will be a great fight."
What corners of the world do people move to Estonia from?
Whereas ten years ago, about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia, this number has been approaching 2,000 in recent years.
The number of residence permit applicants grew in leaps and bounds during the Ukrainian crisis – in 2014, 1,087 received a temporary residence permit, 675 in the year before that.
While Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, Russian citizens come for family migration.
“Considering the historical Russian community here, this they have likely the closest family ties to people living in Russia,” said Academy of Security Sciences migration researcher Helina Maasing.
“The jump is because instead of extending residence permits, they have applied for a new residence permit for permanently settling in Estonia,” said interior ministry press representative Rammus, who said interest among Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has tended to be stable for years.
As of last year, foreign nationals who have lived here at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanently settling in Estonia.
The residence permit for long-term residents requires five years, for instance.
Now Ukrainians can change their employer and the Estonian state no longer keeps close tabs on whether the salary criterion is fulfilled.
In total, 1,968 people received a residence permit for the purpose of settling in Estonia, also including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become the country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
In their case as well, the rule is that where a community has taken shape ahead of them, others arrive more easily,” added Rammus.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, North Korea, and just as many from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
In total, according to Statistics Estonia, 14,822 people immigrated to Estonia, and 13,792 emigrated.
Most immigrants and emigrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the ones leaving.
Estonians migrate between Finland and Estonia the most.

From 4-13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Convent again turn into the venue for the Birgitta Festival started 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klas.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic Risto Joost, 36.
Risto Joost: Listeners will hear opera classics La Traviata and Tosca, see ballet performances from Bolero to “Karlsson” and there’s even an in-production in the programme, which this time will be a performance of Joseph Haydn’s wonderful oratorio The Seasons by the same international creative team that brought another Haydn masterpiece to the stage at Pirita in 2015, The Creation.
There is much more at Birgitta Festival than just concerts and theatre performances.
Because the experience that listeners get in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human spirits resonate and touches human senses in a way that can’t be described.

It isn’t just empty words.
Do you have any ritual before the ascend the conductor’s podium?
It’s a little moment for myself.
But in general, I don’t have a chance to rest up or take a short nap before a big performance.
Actually I like interacting actively with people, even before ascending the podium.
Watch the enjoyable video with Risto Joost!
New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.

“I’ve been toughened up,” she says with a bit of a grin.
Orel confirmed that she was satisfied with her World Championships debut and that many good competitions lay ahead for her: “I came here with the 32nd or last place result, and I finished in 18th place.
I will come away with a good experience and someday I’ll be wanting to compete for medals.
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."
Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Urmet, working in the medicine tent at Weekend, told Õhtuleht yesterday that they have had to dispense quite a few bandages.
Blisters and abrasions are the main ones, sprains and mild falls.
Urmet says patrons come to the festival with the wrong footwear and that causes problems.
Watch the video whether festivalgoers also ask medics for pain relievers for hangovers.
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.
Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.
The electric car revolution is transforming demand for metals
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in the next two decades more electric cars will be sold than cars that use petroleum-derived fuels.
“It will change everything with regard to some metals,” Capital Economics commodities analyst Simona Gambranini told Bloomberg.
The market is already responding to the changing trend.
This year, cobalt has already risen 70 per cent in price on the London Metal Exchange.
Last year’s price rise was 37 per cent.
Copper, too, is up 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
On the loser’s side, there companies engaged in lead, like Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to the new era.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
If lead demand falls, it will happen slowly.
Perhaps it will happen in about ten years’ time.
Steel producers not asleep.
AK Steel Holding is partnered with General Motors for using nanotechnology for manufacturing incredibly light car bodies.
Some success can be seen in Europe.
The end of the oil era can lead to tribulations for platinum as well.
“Many commodities in high demand such as oil and platinum may not necessarily have high demand in future,” said commodities analyst for Natixis, Bernard Dahdah.
Platinum producers believe there will be continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Platinum producers’ big hope in the 10-year perspective rests with the hydrogen element based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai, which depend on platinum for producing electricity from hydrogen.
“Diesel appears to be the clear loser on the way to electric cars,” said Brunet from Exane BNP Paribas.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.

Linda’s husband watched the orchard she’d planted blow down.
The storm surge came up to the window, water sprayed in through the windows,” said Ms. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu back then.
Compared to Lääne County, Lääne-Viru County did not sustain particularly severe damage compared to the August storm of 1967, but the losses were high there, too, Virumaa Teataja reported in 2007.
The chickens are in the air and can’t come down anymore,” Virumaa Teataja reported.
The Põlli Manor building in Viljandi County was so badly damaged by the storm that it was decided later to raze it.
The secret of clean beaches: nightly cleanup and poor beach weather
Seagulls shriek at Stroomi Beach in North-Tallinn.
If it’s nice weather, people are at the beach, and if it isn’t, there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, the head of cleaning operations for the private company Haabersti Haldus.
Usov has been on duty since four o’clock.
Years ago, there was a lot more of it.
The price of a clean beach
For instance, at Pirita beach, 400,000 tonnes has to be hauled away each beach season.
“That’s an unbelievable amount,” notes Usov.
The 1.5-km-long Stroomi beach strand has eight large dumpsters that need to be emptied three times a week.
That is how much waste is generated.
Still, the cooler summer weather has meant that there is one-fifth less waste than otherwise.
As today’s haul, Usov has shovelled around 10 model cars out of the sand.
“Usually more of them emerge, but this is a normal yield.” Usov already knows that soon he will find them in the sand again.
Rubbish is spread around
The noise, which lasts from the night hours to early morning, disturbs the sleep of the people living in the neighbourhood.
In one month, the beach has to be sifted twice.
“If we don’t do it, the city district will fine us,” says Scholler.
“Compared to the rest of Europe, there is a lot more work in Estonia to keep the beaches maintained,” says Scholler.
In the morning, it’s a disgusting scene everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and bottle collectors, who have turned the trash bags upside down,” says Martin.
In general, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi Beach.
It can be seen that the city is caring for it.
The playgrounds, illuminated and freshly asphalted paths have made it more pleasant.
Once upon a time, you could roller-skate only on one path,” says Martin.
Treasures found at Stroomi: coins, only coins
The gods of the sea are not that generous.
“There usually isn’t any gold, rings and suchlike,” the treasure hunter says.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
In July, the difference in the next-day exchange process of power in the Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania bidding area decrease to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros this June, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference was faults in the Lithuania-Sweden connection.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose 12 and seven per cent, respectively.
During the remaining nine per cent of the hours, no next-day transactions took place between the two countries.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity flowed from Estonia to Latvia 99% of the time and during 73% of the hours, the entire transmission capacity was in use.
The price of carbon dioxide, which impacts the power generation price, rose last month and transactions were conducted at a price of 5.04 to 5.47 euros per tonne.
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
That was my requirement," she says.
The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.
The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
How'd that work out?
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
The ones Õhtuleht spoke to said admitted they were busking in the Old Town without the city government permit.
In spite of their appearance, the only woman in the group played a tune with a jolly rhythm on the accordion, while one of the men juggled three balls and beckoned to passersby.
First of all, we didn’t know.
There’s no point in paying for that,” said Bob.
Three young Polish men were also busking on Viru Street, one of whom was playing the violin, another the clarinet and a third had even hauled out an electronic piano.
“Of course we don’t have that,” he said in a light-hearted manner.
The central bank is not releasing more details on the purchases.
The central bank buys up bonds on the market, to encourage the investors who sold the bonds to invest money elsewhere.
In general, in the context of the public sector bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its own government bonds, other countries’ bonds are not purchased.
Central banks also make substitute purchases in countries with a limited supply of the bonds conforming to the purchase programme.
The Bank of Estonia has been purchased bonds as part of the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the interim, Elering bonds were purchased, but as of June 2016, the Bank of Estonia no longer buys Elering bonds.
Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'
Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.

But he does admit the true top calibre performers have arrived in Pärnu.
“Looking at the level of artists that they’ve managed to bring to Estonia, these are the absolute top names in the musical genre – that doesn’t often happen in these parts,” says the minister of culture.
Which of the artists performing at the festival resonate with Saar most?
He also cites a number of other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5 and Knifeparty.
Actually, the concentration of well-known names is very high,” he says.

Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
European Union flags will be purchased for Estonian schools for 20,000 euros.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 flags is put by the Ministry of Education at €20,000. In other words, one flag costs €35.
A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.
It's important to change their routines, they are told.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
Valdez was 50 years old.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two errors contributed to the killing.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
Trusting one's instincts.
The landscape constantly shifts.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.
The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.
On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.
"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
I was angry and crying."
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."
"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 tips for getting over the Weekend Festival hangover
Drink water.
Along with the water, minerals are also flushed out of the body, and so it is good to drink mineral water.
Take a walk.
But a light walk helps the body remember what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping off a hangover is a more time-consuming way of recovering.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will rob your body of the last liquid.
Don’t count on pain relievers.
If you take a pain reliever in the evening to avoid hangover, your liver has to deal with the acetaminophen or ibuprofen in addition to the alcohol and will lose strength.
If you take a pain reliever in the morning, don’t take it on an empty stomach – it will irritate your already inflamed stomach.
Or if you don’t have a partner, you can get along well with yourself.
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Responses were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, deceitful.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
In addition to the snap surveys and polls of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - allowing her to drill down on why.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
And if the chief executive is implicated, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
There's a growing body of research showing today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But the data are useless unless a company's custodians take action.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you're going to lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you're going to lose companies."

A music video filmed on the roof of the city district government with a Russian language pop song, featuring an appearance by the Lasnamäe district’s mayor; and a very primitive computer game in which the main character Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to ride a bike down a street avoiding puddles and squirrels along his way – is that how the Centre Party will try to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-olds allowed to vote for the first time?
We will have to wait to see what other parties imagine a youthful election campaign to be.
Whereas instead of entertainment programming, viewers of Kanal 2 or TV3 see only a blank screen starting in early August, there are two choices: to accept that in the future, we will see only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels on free-to-air TV, or pay 10 euros to some TV operator each month.
There are presumably those who will initially cheer the commercial-free TV experience, yet ultimately – even if reluctantly – pay for TV programming and commercials.
Ear-splitting music, loud crowds and trash left on the street – these are the adverse effects of nearly every larger music festival.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the president.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.
Young Setos in Siberia are moving to town, pensioners back to the countryside.
Anatoli Yevseyev is continuing the tradition of the famous Seto goldminers along the river Mana.
This year marks 30 years since her first research trip to Siberia.
That’s an unsettled question.
Look how big this territory here was!
The Setos came here as peasants, but their life changed, because they found themselves in regions that weren’t tied only to agriculture but also to the river (log barges), gold-mining, industry.
Yes, they lived in compact fashion.
They’re different, even though the aspects that were brought were once the same there.
They brought with them a great many folk costumes.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it’s colder here.
Foods changed.

Piho is referring to people from the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida Village in early July for the Seto kingdom day and lived in homes for four days - J.P.
What is left here is astonishing.
“You can’t see that lovely place from the train window,” chuckles Reigo.
I’ve gone swimming there, it’s completely possible!
“There’s an amazing view of Tapa from Männikumägi hill, but there’s also recreational trails for running or skiing in winter, and, say, play disc golf – the disc golf course has been established, and the discs can be rented from the sports centre,” says Reigo.
Veteran players go there with their own discs, but I haven’t made it there yet.
At least during ski lessons.
To say nothing of broken sleds and skis.
“The house is small but there are great many exhibits and a huge amount of information,” says Reigo in praising the place, which is full of the history of the town of Tapa, the majority of which focuses on the railway and the military.
“We have good places to eat and sometimes, siting in the café, you feel that you’re abroad,” he says.
Two Bulgarians Were Detained For Illegal Camping in Greece
The ministry of foreign affairs reported bTV that Bulgarians were later released.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
Wolves teaching pups preying on sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, wolves killed one sheep on Reheselja Village’s pastureland and grievously injured another one; that sheep had to be put down.
The rules for handling of genetic modified crops must be clear.
The Ministry of Rural Affairs has sent draft legislation amending the Release into Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to ministries for endorsement.
The amendment to the legislation forgoes the creation of a separate database on locations of genetically modified (GM) crops as well as for handlers; the plant health register will be used henceforth for this purpose.
At least until such time that a decision has been taken to declare Estonia GMO-free,” said the head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs, Sigmar Suu.
All parties have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with it in the draft legislation information system and if desired, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes affect, above all, persons engaged in the field of plant protection, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
To this point, no Estonian agricultural producers are interested in growing GM crops.
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
"To get three out of four I thank the club for that," he added.
According to bird watcher Mati Martinson, who lives on Sõrve peninsula, the first young crane to get a transmitter was tagged in Sõrve, and this brood is already flying around, has left the nest area and joined the large population roosting on Mullutu-Suurlaht bay.
This is because Sõrve does not have any fields of grain, Saarte Hääl reports.
This Tuesday, relatively late for this round of tagging cranes, another young crane got a transmitter, this one on Muhu Island.
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The note adds that should the departure from the White House be delayed, a second aircrew would be needed for the return flight due to duty-hour restrictions.
"Sounds like you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Grit Šadeiko – peace and happiness come through tears
The 2012 European championships in Helsinki were marred by an injury sustained in the javelin throw, but in her debut Olympics in London, she got 23rd with 6013 points.
At the 2013 Moscow World Championships, the Estonian was on track for an Estonian record when she suffered an foot injury in the long jump.
I’d just like to have a decent performance at the heptathlon or similar events.
Just once,” confessed Šadeiko.
She had to take time off – whether to continue in the heptathlon at all?
Was two days of effort worth all this, anyway?
It’s relatively hard to describe this experience, but I’ve thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
“I knew that it wasn’t time to pack up and retire,” says Šadeiko about her self-cleansing.
I was able to turn a new page and continue with the same momentum.
“But Grit said she won’t give up and wants to prove to herself what she’s worth,” says Mägi.
Now there’s some kind of peace within her.
She does it for pleasure.
Her lust for competing came back in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record at the Götzis with 6,280 points.
At this high-level competition, she bested her own top result in the shot put by close to a metre (13.89) and ran a near-record in the hurdles.
Mägi, who has been coaching her for years, says Šadeiko is a model student.
That is what we have to start from.

“The taste isn’t in the wine, the taste is created by the person tasting the wine,” Shepherd says.
Of course, Shepherd admonishes that wine isn’t for getting drunk on.
“There’s more to it than that,” he says.

Fifty-nine IT and telecom companies took part in the ICT sector salary survey conducted by Fontes.
Sixty-three per cent of the positions were filled by men.
“Although only three companies mentioned that the pay difference was in favour of the men and the rest of the companies believed there was no salary difference, in reality, comparing similar wok against each other, the men’s basic salary was an average 10% higher than the women’s and the men’s total annual salary was an average of 8% higher than that of the women,” said Fontes analyst Ilmar Põhjala.
With season three, the DEA has turned their attention towards the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" just with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel's leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) being the brains, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) running the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) based in New York.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the U.N. Assistance Mission said hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly-registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports 1.2 million women are registered out of 3.6 million total registered voters.
The joy of sharing makes everything even cooler, for big as well as for small.
More advanced lifters can also do squats with pretty big kids.
For the kid, it’s balance training, they count the repetitions, and it’s fun to be able to sit high and mighty.
Bigger children can also do squats at the same time.
Keep your fingers straight, ask your mini-helper to hold on tight.
The kid can count repetitions and play coach.
To add resistance, you can stay in the plank position, the little one on your back, and walk around in that position as well.
Bend your knees and straighten up.
Life for the little coach is especially jolly when he gets a little kiss at the top of each movement.
Make sure that your back stays in a neutral position.
Keep an eye on the child’s safety, the position of your knee, and keep your back in a neutral position.
A favourite for all kids and a lot of fun!
Ott (10), Säde (8) and Õnne (4) served as the exercise equipment.
From the Philippines to the wide world – straw bags journey into the hearts of fashion fans
You just had it and if you didn’t, there was nothing wrong.
The amount of variety has made straw bags a real summer fling for women.
Chanel’s version of the straw bag will set you back about 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion hits, straw bags are not from some big fashion mecca but their origins lie further off.
As straw bags don’t have to be woven as strongly as a basket, patterns and other materials can be interwoven into them, which makes the bag more distinctive and, on that account, more attractive.
As with fad products, brand have come up with all sorts of interpretations besides the classic look.

The police continued the search this morning.
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
"We respect all clubs.
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
“I can’t imagine who would gain from this,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the current freedom of movement of people and goods, he said.
“This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders,” he stressed.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
“A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace,” said the Taoiseach.
He called Brexit “our generation’s challenge” and warned that the outcome could affect all aspects of everyday life for Northern Ireland.
