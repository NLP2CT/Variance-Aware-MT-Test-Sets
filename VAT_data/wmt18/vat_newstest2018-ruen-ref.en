The problem was systemic throughout the entire country.
Here is a typical case.
The person invested all of their working capital, fully satisfied their commitments, but didn’t receive the allotted money when it was due.
Now, in a number of regions, they have managed to mitigate the problem to the greatest extent possible.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
Two people have died as a result of a shooting of a police patrol in Egypt
All the wounded were taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police officers stopped a vehicle, at which point the two armed individuals inside of the car opened fire on the law enforcement officials.
One of the perpetrators has been apprehended, but the second managed to escape.
The Russian Federal Tourism Agency supports the law eliminating the free baggage allowance for non-refundable airline tickets
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law giving airline companies the right to eliminate the free baggage allowance rule on non-refundable airline tickets.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office reported a reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed increasing the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
Residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, let him know about problems with conducting business activities.
Previously, the Ministry of Economic Development proposed solving the problem by amending the land code and the law on environmental protection.
The church was named in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, since the Orthodox Church venerates him as the patron of travellers, including fishermen.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while carefully placing the butts into a small iron box he brought with him from the office.
Nowadays, the fact is, there are cameras everywhere.
And it’s true: the sidewalks in downtown Singapore are clean, as if in a museum.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and he was sentenced to flogging.
What?!
He received ten lashings with a wooden cane to his buttocks and spent a week in jail.
Here, in general, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport: he was carrying 400 g of cocaine on him.
The Australian prime minister (threatening sanctions), international human rights advocates, and even the Pope came to his defense.
Since then, drug traffickers carefully bypass our country.
There is only one outcome in the given situation: if they find half a kilo of cocaine on you, then you will be hanged.
To prevent fires, smokers are forbidden from bringing lighters into the metro, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
Basically, you get the feeling that no matter how hard you try, you will inevitably break something.
That’s far from the case, says Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency, in an attempt to change my mind.
Compliance with the fundamental rules is rigorously monitored.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that crime is very rare in Singapore.
Is it justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads: motorists ignored traffic lights, drove however they wanted, and got behind the wheel drunk.
After the introduction of fines, everything calmed down within a year.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a type of detention camp.
“But how can it be?” you ask in astonishment.
Anything can happen.
More often than not, this is enough to ensure that a person behaves properly.
But, you know what?
I walked around in Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City very cautiously: motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras right out of tourists’ hands.
The center of Paris is full of dirty transients and panhandlers.
It makes you think.
It’s just human nature: remember, no one buckled-up behind the wheel in Russia either, until they started to issue fines.
As for the rest of Singapore’s laws, at the very least, it’s worth taking a closer look at them.
Is nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty
Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.
There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.
The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States."
Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.
"Eilidh is slightly modest.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.
Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.
And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.
I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
But it matters.
And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
This shouldn't be so hard.
And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.
It's a wonderful place to play golf in.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Peculiar tunnels above the freeway, capable of absorbing the carbon monoxide emitted by automobiles, are already being tested on the roads in Great Britain.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is due to traffic, and poor air quality accounts for up to 40,000 premature deaths each year.
The Moscow City Court has changed the sentence for the disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow City Court has changed the sentence for the disabled man, Aton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in a penal colony, to a fine in the amount of 200,000 rubles.
Previously, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to change the prison term to a suspended sentence, explaining its request by the fact that Mamayev’s illness “prevents him from being in prison conditions.”
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at an off-site session in the pretrial detention facility.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
Polygamy is common here.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.
There is no public transport.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.
"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.
Andrey Malakhov has indicated to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrey Malakhov dropped a hint for his fans on Instagram about who is to blame for his departure from First Channel.
If we recall the numerous reports about the host not being able to find common ground with the recently arrived producer, who set out to reformat “Let Them Talk”, it becomes clear what he was dropping such strong hints about, KP writes.
The situation surrounding the termination could become clear in the coming days.
Five soldiers were killed by a car bomb in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in a bombing in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reports.
We are aware of 20 fatalities.
A new incident occurred in Girishk on Friday morning.
A diver has recorded a video of a shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured on video a shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
The clip was posted to Facebook by a division of the American Agency for Marine Fisheries in the state of Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
Having noticed the human, the animal, with a length of more than three meters, swam up to him.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in this way to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could have easily destroyed the device.
Some details about this brawl have been revealed already.
Soldiers from the sixth company sided with the officer.
More than ten people were injured in the massive fight.
More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
166 people voted to extend the suspension, with 21 against, TASS reports.
The team consisted of 19 people who were cleared for competition by the IAAF.
For more on the latest IAAF Council report, read the Kommersant article: “The IAAF has extended sanctions against the ARAF”.
After the recent defeat at the hands of the Kalugans, with a score of 0-3, many predicted in advance an easy win for the home team.
In the 1st half, the Kalugans were more active and had the advantage in terms of possession of the ball.
The death knell for our team turned out to be defensive mistakes that enabled the Kalugans to make a series of critical plays.
Following a dangerous attack, Khimik moved the ball to corner area, which the home team kicked into the net without opposition.
Yury Dubrovin was the goal scorer.
The Khimik lineup: Sirotin, Manokhin (c), Romaschenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoyevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Staff from the funeral agency and representatives from the mayor’s office will meet the flight at its final destination point, said Abkhazia’s deputy minister for resorts and tourism, Astamyr Akhba.
Two Russian citizens were killed as a result of the accident, Yelena Polyakova (born in 1970) and Yelena Timofeeva (born in 1962), who were vacationing nearby the hydrosulfuric spring.
Currently, seven people remain in hospital and the rest have been released.
A grand jury will be involved in investigating Russian influence in the US election
The special prosecutor will examine the collected material and will decide if it is sufficient to file charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimonial evidence.
One of the topics of inquiry for the panel of jurors, which started working several weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting between the son of then presidential candidate, Donald Trump, with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Mueller himself already promised to verify the details of this meeting held in June 2016.
They have already been examined by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his team of lawyers.
Previously, Trump Jr. said that he was expecting to get dirt on the headquarters of the Democratic Party’s candidate, Hillary Clinton, but that no such incriminating documents were presented, and the conversation ended up being about adoption.
At the beginning of August, information appeared in some media sources that Trump Jr.’s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was practically dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House made it clear that the president did not dictate anything, but simply exercised his authority, as any father would do.
The Deputy Mayor of Penza was detained in the workplace
The mayor’s office for Penza has not yet commented on what has happened.
Prior to this, she worked for a long time as the department head of the State Inspectorate for Housing and Construction for Penza Oblast.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992, thanks to public protests, and was relocated from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin’s 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the given name and surname of the first cosmonaut sound in Latvian, and he looks as though he has reached the age of 70.
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
"Get him out of the car!"
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.
"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
But not one was ever prosecuted.
Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
"I said n---a, get off my property!"
Rascona fires back.
There's a beat.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
Did I go too hard?
"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"
"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"
Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
Absolutely no one laughs.
A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.
One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.
They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.
He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.
The opposition figure was found guilty of committing an administrative offence specified in part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation, “Repeat violation of the procedure for organizing a rally”.
Navalny himself and another colleague of the opposition figure, Nikolai Lyaskin, also received summons.
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at a wedding, including the bride.
Three women and one man were wounded as a result.
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man started shooting because the wedding guests, having decided to go swimming, walked through his territory on their way to the pond.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions on account of Siemens
Earlier, it was reported that a final decision would be made by the end of the day, and a decision has been made: sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.

British actor Robert Hardy has died
The Independent newspaper reported this on Thursday.
His relatives spoke about his death.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, he acted alongside Laurence Olivier on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in “The Tragedy of Coriolanus”.
Hardy is also remembered for his multiple performances as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the film adaptations of Agatha Christie’s works about Miss Marple.
Robert Hardy also had the chance to play the role of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on more than one occasion.
This year is the couple’s “golden” wedding anniversary; however, the order of the day isn’t preparations for the celebration, but rather a grave dispute.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Best of luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
I'm small for 140.
And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.
That's what the fans are asking for.
Let's give them that."
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
"We're the main names.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.
I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Several central roads in Moscow will be closed to traffic over the weekend
This weekend, August 5 and 6, traffic in the capital will be restricted in the area of Tverskaya Street between Nastasinsky Lane and Triumphal Square; traffic will also be restricted along 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In addition to this, Leningradsky Prospekt will be closed to traffic from the Third Ring Road to 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
A section of Moskvoretskaya Embankment will also be closed to traffic on the weekend.
Construction of Zaryadye Park is still underway there.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
I’ll think about whether to run for the presidency
During a working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin stated that he is ready to think about whether to run for the Russian presidency in the 2018 election, Interfax reports.
“Fine, I will think about it, thank you”, the president said in response.
Peskov called these suppositions “groundless, hypothetical speculation”.
“So far there is no headquarters: it will be quite some time before a headquarters is established and the election campaign is still a long way off”, Peskov said.
West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
The rally erupted in cheers.
"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
A court has placed a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason under arrest
Journalist Vasily Muravitsky, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), has been placed under arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
While the commander-in-chief of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to repel the Italian ships.
The situation was discussed last week during negotiations between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and Fayez al-Sarraj, head of the Cabinet of Libya, which is recognized by Europe.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working to fix the problems that residents of Europe and North America were facing, clarifies RIA Novosti.
Two Team Ukraine leaders in track and field were suspended from participating in the World Championships
Olga Zemlyak and Olesia Povkh, who specialize in sprinting, were excluded from the Team Ukraine roster for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This decision was made by the organization’s executive committee in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against the track athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from August 4-13.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."
The president will determine the procedure and location of the oath-taking ceremony
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president: the State Duma Committee on State-Building and Legislation has prepared such amendments to the second reading of the corresponding law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as the legally incapacitated, will be exempt from taking the solemn oath, it appears from a revised text of amendments to the proposed law “On Citizenship of the Russian Federation” (Izvestia has a copy at its disposal), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on July 11.
However, it was unclear from the text of the bill where this ceremony should take place: there is list of places where it is possible to place the emblem of the Russian Federation, which is regulated according to federal constitutional law.
Those wishing to receive Russian citizenship will swear the solemn oath after officials examine their documents.
However, it appears from the revised text that an individual will only receive a Russian passport after they have taken the oath.
A notarized copy of the application form will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
A renouncement of “foreign” citizenship, as is the case right now, is not required if it is provided for by international agreement or if it is not possible “due to factors beyond the control of the individual”.
The respective amendment to the law was suggested by a group of deputies, including First Vice-Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov, and Ayrat Farrakhov (all from United Russia).
Furthermore, a person with dual citizenship or permanent residency in another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
Many of the core stories are the same.
Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.
The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.
The prize money for the Russian Football Super Cup match between Spartak and Lokomotiv will amount to about 30 million rubles.
He also added that, by now, there are hardly any tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, July 14 at 9:30 p.m.
As noted by TASS, Spartak is the current Russian champion, while Lokomotiv holds the country’s Cup title.
The other day, a 37-year-old resident of Ufa, who owns a furniture business, contacted the police.
The young thieves’ loot consisted of tools worth a total of almost 200,000 rubles: two welding units, a perforating machine, a hydraulic system, and a lift.
Immediately after this, the young men sold the stolen equipment to the first available auto service center.
A criminal case for theft has already been initiated against them, while law enforcement officers were able to return just some of the stolen tools to their rightful owner.
Such a statement was delivered by the State Department’s official spokesperson, Heather Nauert, in response to the remarks of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on the relations of the two states.
“This is an example of good US-Russian cooperation”, RIA Novosti quotes the diplomat as saying.
Dior has “grown” roses made of amethysts and quartz
Five new rings and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons have been added to them.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellane, was inspired by the roses that fashion designer Christian Dior grew at his estate in Granville and by the Bagatelle and Pré-Catelan gardens in Paris.
Trump has found the culprits behind deteriorating relations with Russia
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK.
Subsequently, the White House released a statement by the president, in which he pointed out that the law would prevent the US from concluding lucrative deals and would bring Russia, China, and North Korea even closer together.
Mr. Prokopenya became the prime contender for the buy-out of the division of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU declined a consortium bid by Grigory Guselnikov’s NorvikBank and Said Gutseriev’s Belorussian company in July.
The Russian Ministry of Energy has identified the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
A truck involved in the accident hit power lines, which led to an outage of the Kuban and connected Crimean power grids.
Power failures were reported in major cities in Crimea last week.
At first, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could have been a heat wave.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."
Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.
PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
State Traffic Safety Inspectorate departments are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IDP).
To get such permits, one must wait their turn for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to go on holiday abroad using their car or rent one there.
The requirements for international driving permits are written in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian permits are recognized already.
It’s possible to register for an appointment on the state services website, but the waitlist on there already extends into the middle of August.
Many Muscovites have already been faced with this issue; messages like this are popping up with increasing frequency on social media:
That’s right, because all of the departments of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: “A question for people in the know!”
Has anyone tried to get one in a different city?
Do you think it will work?
This might be related to the shortage, however, it’s unclear what changes they are talking about, since nothing was announced previously.
The Ministry of Transport came up with this proposal.
The new version of the international driver’s permit (IDP) has been in use since May 31, 2011.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview on the Obozrevatel website.
Not a single self-respecting international company would put even a tiny bolt or nut in there, because they would risk losing their business in the EU, USA, Japan – the countries that joined in sanctions against Russia in relation to Crimea.
On July 31, construction workers finished installing the vehicle arch of the Crimea Bridge.
On the Kerch shore, preassembly of the road transport arch of the Crimea Bridge has been completed: its arch is capped at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
What kind of angelic patience (or utter indifference to public service) did the boss of the Spanish official, Carlos Recio, have to possess?
The permanent absence spanned a long 10 years.
But not by his direct supervisor.
What doesn’t happen in the world of bureaucracy?
But, nevertheless, officials always manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live quite well.
This time the “sensation” hails from Spain.
And then, the “wonderful times” of Mr. Recio came to an end.
And then, he immediately left for home.
He showed up at the workplace again at 4:00 p.m., in order to once again register in the system that he had left.
They’re proposing to protect judges from chairpersons
For appeal and cassation courts, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative territorial divisions of the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals as part of the presidential mandate.
Experts suggest that a specially written computer program can do this.
Currently, all court chairpersons (from the republic courts right down to the district courts) are appointed by the president for six years, upon the recommendation of the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
The experts are using the experience of arbitration courts as a model.
“These are only our proposals”, a member of the HRC and a retired judge for the Constitutional Court, Tamara Morshchakova, explained to Kommersant.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.
For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."
These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."
The government has confirmed the establishment of a commission for cultural policy
The deputy chair of the Russian Government has been appointed as head of the commission.
Inflation in G20 countries has declined to an eight-year low
As such, the agency recorded the first week-long deflation in 2017.
The Ministry of Economic Development, however, is of the opinion that the target value has already been achieved: according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Regular telephone communication has been established at the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
Journalists have learned about instances where one officer or another has received birthday greetings across the frontline from his official enemy.
UAF soldiers and DNR and LNR rebels have been sitting in the trenches along the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a military operation against Donbass.
May the unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us remain on the conscience of those delegations.
Vladimir Putin has come out in favor of limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of businesses
As Kommersant reported, as a result of the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of businesses is growing.
Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How'd that work out?
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.
According to the investigation, the child died because her mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
The case against the female resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (infliction of death by negligence) in April, following the death of her 3-year-old daughter from a stage 4B HIV infection.
A request for this was filed by the father of the dead girl, explaining that he had “forgiven his wife, holds no claims against her, and that she has made amends and has apologized”.
The prosecutor’s office did not agree with the court’s decision and filed an appeal demanding a reversal of the decision to dismiss the case and that it be sent for a retrial.
The young girl died and making amends for the harm caused by the crime is impossible.
What dangers do HIV dissidents present?
Doctors and activists of AIDS service NGOs call these views anti-medical and see their spread as a serious threat.
A gruesome photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, happened on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany train station in Khmelnytskyi.
One of the friends came up with the idea of taking a dramatic selfie on the roof of the wagon, the police communications desk in Khmelnytskyi Oblast reported to FAKTY.
The injured individual was moved to a safe place before the arrival of doctors and was then hospitalized in the burn unit of the Khmelnytskyi Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with 1st and 2nd degree burns to his torso.
Oceans could have existed on ancient Venus.
French scientists have put forward such a hypothesis.
Another one was given medical assistance, after which he was let go.
The third wounded individual is a minor and there are no details about his condition.
Its title stems from A. Huxley’s famous dystopian novel, “Brave New World”.
Listeners helped the band collect money to record the album: more than 1,200 people supported the project on the Planeta.ru website.
Ticket prices range from 1,200 to 2,600 rubles.

I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.
Crimea is incorporating the New World sparkling wine factory
100% of the enterprise’s shares will remain the property of the government of Crimea.
Depreciation of the enterprise’s fixed assets is around 60-70%.
1.2 billion rubles are required to modernize the enterprise. Given the nature of its legal and organizational form, it is obliged to hand over 50% of its profits to the state budget.
The enterprise was established in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn, as a factory to produce sparkling wine at the New World estate acquired by him.
The factory is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders knocked over more than 40 headstones
In total, 24 people contacted the police in connection with this.
Preventative measures have been carried out with both the children and their parents.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.
The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.
Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the auspices the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and State Duma and assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told Kommersant what objectives Moscow is pursuing in this region and whom they are placing their bets on.
There is almost nothing known about the contact group that you head on Libya.
While, for example, everyone knows about the contact group on Ukraine.
What exactly are you doing and what objectives are you pursuing?
Its activities are overseen by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (a Duma deputy from Chechnya – Kommersant).
The impetus for establishing the group was the detainment of the Russian tanker, Mekhanik Chebotarev, in Libya (in September 2015; 11 people were on board – Kommersant).
And how did it turn out that you, specifically, took charge of it?
Thanks to the active involvement of Ahmed Maiteeq (the deputy prime minister of Libya – Kommersant), we managed to quickly negotiate the release of the Russian sailors.
How many people are part of the contact group and how many of them are permanently posted in Libya?
None of our staff are permanently posted in Libya, as there is currently no need for this.
Are there Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya right now?
But it was important for us to assess the situation there for ourselves: to analyze the actual military capacity, who is responsible for what, why such rumors are floating about, and what the real role of the Islamists is there.
In Misurata, we met with all of the representatives of the units that were engaged in destroying IS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from militants of the Islamic State, which is banned in Russia – Kommersant).
We wanted to take a look at them, to get to know these people, to verify the intelligence that it was actually these people who played a decisive role in destroying IS in Libya and not Halif Haftar, who has taken credit for these achievements.
Was it not Haftar who defeated the Islamic State in Libya?
It wasn’t him engaged in this.
In the recent past, both the leaders spoke very negatively about one another.
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe this.
We were confronted with this situation when we were in Misurata, and Haftar, on that very same day, came aboard the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn’t believe it was a coincidence in Misurata.
You have associated with Haftar.
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
But the fact that he studied here, of course, makes dialogue with him easier.
And they are drawn to Russia; they feel nostalgic about it to a certain extent.
Do you consider a lifting of the arms embargo placed on Libya likely in the near future?
Raising this issue right now is pointless and dangerous: it would only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, information made it into the media about how Italy, faced with the issue of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels like it is being left high and dry by its allies in the EU.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia’s support, because Moscow is engaged in simultaneous dialogue with Haftar, and with al-Sarraj, and with Misurata, and with the south of the country.
Are you talking about Southerners stopping the flow of migrants on the periphery?
We are aiming for this.
But it isn’t easy.
We hope to facilitate the inclusion of Southerners in the negotiation process between al-Sarraj, Haftar, and the tribes in the South.
Yes, but he personally supports the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country: moderately Islamic and open to the world.
Tripoli is the capital after all: it’s where the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government are located.
Of course, some countries had an interest in not having us involved there.
But we’ve gone and thwarted their plans and have started to engage with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
What will Russia do with it?
There are plans to resign contracts that were concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
In particular, we are talking about previous agreements in the transportation sector (the construction of railways), the energy sector (electrification), and several other sectors.
And do the Libyans have anything to pay with?
I don’t know what kind of arrangement it will be; I’m not directly involved with these matters.
In fact, economics aren’t the most important thing for Russia in Libya.
Ultimately, we are engaged in peace-building efforts there.
He said that he has around 50,000 recordings of telephone conversations of members of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya – Kommersant) and no spoken Russian can be heard.
But which states are the fighters coming from then?
Then we’ll put the question differently.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya are Libyan themselves.
There are hardly any Libyans among them: they make up no more than 5%.
The rest of them are outsiders.
There are such plans.
When might these negotiations take place?
It’s hard to say right now.
Several visits still need to take place, at which point I hope there will be some clarity as to the time and place of the negotiations.
Benefactors at the Chekhov Museum raised money for an expensive gift for a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, and is completely blind, will receive the gift of a specialized treadmill on August 5 at the Moscow-area Melikhovo museum-reserve.
The money for the exercise equipment was raised during the “Don’t stop doing good deeds” charity marathon, which took place at Melikhovo on July 15 on Chekhov Memorial Day.
“I would really like to receive the gift of a treadmill, so my legs can become strong, and so that I can learn how to walk a little bit”.
And now Sasha’s dream has come true!
After the presentation, a “Post Scriptum Concert” will be held at the museum-reserve, where the famous pianist and honored artist of Russia, Alexander Gindin, will play a medley of popular classical works.
In the words of the suspect, he was enraged by the noise, the department of police communication for Zhytomyr Oblast reported to FAKTY.
After this, the man went to a café located nearby.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care and there is no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical services responded to the scene; however, by that time, the shooter had fled.
Based on the evidence, criminal proceedings have been initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The individual in custody faces imprisonment for a period of between 3 to 7 years.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.
Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to better her own.
"She has shown no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.
Evgeny Bogachev: “I let Langford go, like a high-flying bird”
One of the VTB United League’s best basketball players, 33-year-old Keith Langford, has left UNICS.
UNICS President Evgeny Bogachev commented on the departure of the American defenseman to Izvestia.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, Evgeny Bogachev said.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
We wish him success in his family life and his playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning silver in the 2015-16 United League.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in EuroLeague history to receive this prize more than once.
It is expected that the American will conclude a 2-year contract in the amount of 5 million dollars.
Langford will be the second EuroLeague star in July who transfers to the Chinese Championship.
Earlier, Panathinaikos’ former center, Ioannis Bourousis, moved to the Chinese CBA.
The 27-year-old tourist had elevated blood pressure and was also having difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
None of the companies described the moves as recalls.
The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
The Regional Office of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Astrakhan Oblast reports that one of the café patrons, who bought a shawarma, paid with the banknote.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is urging residents of Astrakhan Oblast to be attentive when making financial transactions; it is recommended that employees of sales outlets install devices to determine the authenticity of money received.
On account of this, a year on the exoplanet lasts for just 1.3 “Earth days”, and its atmosphere is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.
And a lot is at stake.
As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Each visitor to the tent could skate on a rink with artificial ice.
50 schoolchildren took part in the event.
It bears noting that the 2019 Winter Universiade ambassadors will help to promote student sport and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The State Department has commented on Medvedev’s words
That being said, Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev’s assertion about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation.
A bodybuilder, who went missing in the Moscow area, was found in a stranger’s dacha suffering from memory loss
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov went missing on the road to Noginsk on July 25, under entirely fascinating circumstances: he stepped out of the car to go to the toilet.
But Shamil was found at a stranger’s dacha in Ramensky.
The owner found him completely naked in his bathroom.
The Dagestani athlete was unable to explain how he got there and what had happened to him.
He couldn’t even remember what his name was and his passport was missing.
Notices about his disappearance helped to identify him.
The medics who responded to the call established that Khanmetov had partial memory loss and a traumatic brain injury, the Mash public page reports.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil have probably already been to his apartment, the keys for which they also stole from him.
Oil and gas revenues for July have exceeded forecasts by 7.4 billion rubles
At the end of July 2017, actual oil and gas revenues earned exceeded estimates by 7.4 billion rubles, the Russian Ministry of Finance reports.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the foreign currency purchase transactions made by the Russian Ministry of Finance.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.
For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
It's a wrenching decision.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"
At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.
This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.
I can count the scales on its sole.'
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get into Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who formerly led Georgia and then Odessa Oblast in Ukraine, arrived by plane in Poland.
Furthermore, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
It is still unclear how he managed to make the transatlantic flight without documents.
The period of investigation for the case against Vainzikher and Olkhovik has been extended until January
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to leaders in Komi.
Their total sum is estimated at no less than a billion rubles.
Vainzikher and Olkhovik were apprehended, transported to Syktyvkar, and held under arrest for two months; Slobodin has evaded investigators and was put on the federal wanted list.
She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.
Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."
In that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.
It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players were suspended for biting US players
Team El Salvador football players Henry Romero and Darwin Cerén received long-term suspensions for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarterfinal match of the Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football’s (CONCACAF) Gold Cup, the Salvadorans bit American players.
The Salvadoran bit striker Jozy Altidore and then he pinched his chest.
Consequently, Romero was suspended for three matches and Cerén for six.
Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
"So never shut up."
"I get goosebumps still talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.
A fire in a 79-storey tower in Dubai has been put out
Local authorities reported that no one was hurt as a result of the incident.

Buzova’s jaw-dropping outfit shocks fans: pants that don’t cover panties
The newly minted singer performed the song “We will be hot”, in a duet with Nastia Kudry, in front of thousands of fans.
The pants were inscribed with the names Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier, it was reported that a specialist from one of Moscow’s plastic surgery clinics commented on changes in Buzova’s appearance.
Yekaterinburg’s metro is introducing a new method of payment
In October, it will be possible to pay for travel on Yekaterinburg’s metro using a bankcard, the General Director of OAO I-Network, Pavel Vedernikov, announced in an interview with Oblastnaya Gazeta.
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
So she called in outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is cropping up to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
Errett said she gained more insight into what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years using Glint.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
"The court of public opinion has usurped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, lodge a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral online.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
Employees want to feel that they're accepted and valued and that they're giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
In fact, if a company asks employees for their feedback, it can set an expectation that change is on the way.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now does monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
In Barnaul, the new asphalt on Krasnoarmeyskiy Prospekt is being dug up
In Barnaul, drastic measures have been taken to determine the reason for asphalt cave-ins on Krasnoarmeyskiy Prospekt.
A decision has been made to “dig up” the area where holes have twice appeared on the recently paved roadway (at the intersection with Molodyozhnaya Street).
This is reported on the official website of the territory’s capital.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to their dorms after the three-hour practice to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The trade-off from no two-a-days is more one-a-days, the Bruins pushing up the start of camp nearly a week from last season and holding practices during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
I think once we get to Saturday and we'll have more time, it will really be great."
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel beginning this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be an issue once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will have security," Mora said.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security up in Parking Lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we got.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
This was reported by the press service of Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarzhon Dzhalilov.
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook is to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact checkers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday as it tries to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact checkers, potentially showing fact-checking results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many think influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
"In addition to seeing which stories are disputed by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog.
Building a graphic novel: A Castle in England's story
In its recent past, the diminutive Scotney Castle has featured in a Squeeze music video and been a bolthole for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
Spanning the middle ages to the Edwardian era, A Castle in England documents the families that lived in Scotney, with each story illustrated by a different, upcoming UK artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
"I welled up at just the thumbprint on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700s who was working for the Jacobites," he says.
To someone 300 years in the future, the smell makes it feel like they're there, too.
For someone so smitten with old papers, getting support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("I overstayed my welcome a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the manor's many treasures and curios, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only starting to tackle the archive, which he describes as "hundreds of years of aristocrats going: 'Oh, stick it in the loft'."
Diaries, letters from the days of the English empire, maps outlining who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was this one birch tree two families were fighting over.
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the tale of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, which features 18th-century contrabander Arthur Darrell, who is thought to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite roguish, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
But Scotney holds a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"It was like: 'Ah, I've got to go deal with fucking real life now.'"
Fifteen of the largest banks choose “Russia”
Depositors will be better off
How will things end?
Right away, let’s answer the main question that comes up with the slightest upset or conflict in the banking sector or close to it: depositors are in no danger, if anything, the reliability of the banking system will improve.
In human resources and organizational terms, it is also clear that no significant disturbances are expected.
And that’s where we will make a decision.
The question still is: as of what year?
Will we close the whole city?
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current scheme.

The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any weirder along comes a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot sector.
Yep.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
So she likes what you like, dislikes what you dislike, etc.
She also has moods during the day just like real people!
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If woman (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website states.
There is little coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights are under threat across the globe, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series The Handmaid's Tale isn't the graphic imagery, the noosed bodies and gouged eyes, but just how realistic that vision feels.
Their creators want them to feel human to the touch, for them to mimic the movement of a real body.
The Los Angeles native, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, competing for Team Ukraine since 2013, won’t be helping our national team in the European Basketball Championship, the final phase of which starts on August 31.
We tried to come to an agreement with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won’t be coming due to family circumstances.
The Ukrainian team will play its group stage matches in the Promise Land.
Trump's great feat?
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US abounded with advice columns on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican sibling she had been bickering with about politics for decades, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
I find myself actively nostalgic these days for Mitt Romney's quaint version of crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, seem very mild offences indeed.
The horses are thunderously huge, the fibre-glass designs on the central cylinder - all gurning clowns and animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in terror - utterly sinister, and the tinkling music oddly transporting.
Thirty-five years later and I'm still not entirely over the day I discovered Swiss Cottage is not, in fact, a Swiss cottage - the theme pub, Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a weirdly magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
Oscar Pistorius taken from jail to hospital with chest pains
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
TASS reported this, citing the official spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, Irina Volk.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast for Airborne Forces Day, an inebriated man walked up to the correspondent and hit him in the face.
It turned out later that this hooligan had no connection whatsoever with the airborne forces.
According to Razvozzhayev, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
The same day they were released, while an investigation is currently underway.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for the purpose.
The ministry said that the court may impose a fine.
Statements made during US Vice President Michael Pence’s European tour came under criticism from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
This is how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw border, said by him in Podgorica.
A paramedic was injured in a traffic accident with an ambulance in the Moscow area
Law enforcement officials are working at the scene of the traffic accident and the circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.
In Odessa Oblast, a woman dumped her newborn son, wrapped up in a plastic bag, at a construction site.
On the evening of August 3, the Razdelnyansky police station received a report from a local resident about how he had found a bag with a newborn inside of it in a partially constructed detached house.
As the main office noted, the family was not previously known to law enforcement officials and wasn’t registered with any particular authorities.
Currently, the newborn is under medical supervision.
Grigory Leps: “I’m ready to leap into action, even though I’m 55, not 30”
One of the most successful entertainers on the Russian stage, Grigory Leps, is celebrating his 55th birthday this coming Sunday.
I remember how your “fiftieth” was marked.
At that moment, you probably thought about how you’d like to spend your next five years.
Did your plans come to fruition?
If we’re talking about my career, this was a successful period.
I released two decent albums.
Of course, today, I’m no longer the person I was, let’s say, 20 years ago.
Singing like I sang in my 30s is becoming more difficult.
In fact, we already recorded everything in my studio and now we’ll send it off to Los Angeles for mastering.
It’s called “Why are you so serious?”, after a song by the same name, which was co-written with Timati.
We’ll do this later, when the music video for it has also been filmed.
The first-rate American drummer, Chris Coleman, had a hand in your new record.
You, it seems, wanted to entice him to join your touring band?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most accomplished drummers in the world today.
He came to me in the studio and recorded his parts.
However, for ongoing work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
We were talking about compensation between €35,000 and €45,000 per month.
At the end of the day, it’s better to feed your own people (smiling).
For example, the guitarist Feodor Dosymov is highly respected internationally.
Western music magazines write about him and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Are you trying to get this ban lifted?
Right now, to be honest, I’m not doing anything.
As a musician, I am really very sorry that I can’t get into America.
I’ve mentioned more than a few times that I learn when I’m there.
We’re no dumber than them, but we don’t have the same experience or schools.
They have been working towards achieving the highest quality of sound.
Now, for some reason, Great Britain has banned me from entering for ten years.
The rest of Europe is friendly toward me.
Will you go to the Laima Vaikule Rendezvous Festival, which starts on July 20 in Jūrmala?
She invited me, and of course, I accepted.
After the tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you would like to turn, once again, to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third be out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I’m also going to try and entice Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to take part in the album.
I walked through the idea with him, we’ve got a good relationship, but he is a busy person, so we’ll have to see what happens.
You’ve also gradually introduced the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov into your repertoire.
Perhaps you’ll also record an album of his stuff later on?
I’ve bumped into him on several occasions and have asked: can I sing this or that song of his?
I suppose it would also be interesting to record an album like this.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer; I invited him to join me.
I might disagree with something in his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
We signed a contract with him and we’re working.
I’m trying to select a repertoire for him and film music videos.
After that, they can go their own way if they want, and I won’t insist that they return the money invested in them.
But if this doesn’t happen, I don’t intend to pull the plug on anyone.
Let everyone work, find their way, and prove themselves like I proved myself a long time ago.
If tomorrow you were offered a road tour across Ukraine and they guaranteed entry into the country, would you go?
I still get invited to go there.
Generally, we’re talking about private events.
And I don’t give a damn what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least not in the near future.
But before, I was performing 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They were welcoming like nowhere else.
They are a very grateful audience.
I also collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik…
There is a multitude of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is truly unfortunate that they are now unable to fully share their talent with the wider Russian audience.
I would be delighted to invite some top-notch Ukrainian performer to Russia, Slava Vakarchuk for example, and hold a joint concert with him.
Andrei Okhlopkov has been transferred from the cosmodrome
It came to Kommersant’s attention that the technical director for the Vostochny Cosmodrome, Andrei Okhlopkov, has taken on a job at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (SSRPC).
Previously, he was de facto in charge of building the Vostochny Cosmodrome, but because of disagreements with the management of the Center for the Operation of Space Ground Based Infrastructure (COSGBI), he was transferred to an enterprise in the Fili neighborhood of Moscow, where he will be engaged in coordinating operations.
“He has been working in the new position for several weeks already”, clarified Kommersant’s industry sources.
It wasn’t possible to get a prompt response from COSGBI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, Kommersant’s information was officially confirmed by SSRPC.
He made the decision to transfer to the position of director for the coordination of operations, the enterprise stated. Andrei Okhlopkov, tasked with providing the minimum number of facilities required for the first launch at Vostochny Cosmodrome, fully accomplished this.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov was a defendant in a criminal case.
In 2012, a trial by jury found him not guilty.
In order to accomplish the launch by the end of the year, they decided to complete construction six months early and deadlines were moved from December to July 2015.
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is overseeing the establishment of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his “space Susanin”, but more often than not, he was requesting information about the pace of construction from him specifically.
Mr. Okhlopkov also stands out in one’s mind for his straightforwardness; for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he suggested stripping the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroi) of its status as the exclusive contractor for Vostochny and working directly with subcontractors: “Why should we put all our eggs in Spetsstroi’s basket?”
According to Kommersant, the reason for Mr. Okhlopkov’s transfer to a new place of work was a disagreement with COSGBI management about the means for completing construction of the cosmodrome’s facilities and complexes, as well as the methods of working with subcontractors.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano and has awards from competitions in both disciplines.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
Officers of the Ministry of Public Safety lowered him to the ground in a helicopter.
There, they are determining if the youth is in the country legally.
According to the news media, these types of experiments are a hobby for him.
He suggested if the same works in humans, a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environment.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
However, having been left out of the Blues' preseason tour of Asia, Matic was severely lacking match fitness and only managed 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
"I will be happier if they get me four of four but they did a great effort for me."
A fine has been imposed against the disabled man, Anton Mamayev
The Moscow City Court has mitigated punishment for the wheelchair-bound disabled man, Anton Mamayev, from four and a half years imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
The convicted defendant was released from a pretrial detention facility by an earlier decision of the Timiryazevsky Court.
The decision of the Moscow City Court reduced Anton Mamayev’s punishment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
“Mamayev is the mastermind of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and as such, this individual should be convicted of a criminal offense”, the press secretary for the Moscow City Court, Ulyana Solopova, explained to Kommersant.
As for Mamayev’s accomplice, Vasily Seroshtanov, the court didn’t find facts that would have provided grounds for recategorizing the severity of the offense and changing the judgment.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
The only legitimate decision would have been an acquittal; I intend to keep fighting for justice.
Izvestia’s sources in the ONF note that the report for the head of state will consist of a “deep analysis” of the situation in all of the country’s federal districts.
According to Izvestia, ONF’s final forum will take place in the fall.
The final conference will be in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
We will form comprehensive proposals to solve environmental issues based on the suggestions made and those that will be made at these events, a source in the ONF told Izvestia.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will be consigned to history, but the most important thing that needs to be done right now is to set in motion environmental protection mechanisms so that they will work for many years to come.
British inventor microchips himself to get into house and car with a wave of hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The message indicated the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remain until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
"One question we asked was if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were informed it was not," the commander wrote.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House, and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
At the event, the President made a push for healthcare reform efforts then underway in the Senate and touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requisitioning their use solely for a photo-op is unusual.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The White House said taxpayers did not pick up the burden for any of the other props featured at the event.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft flight time as 30 minutes each way from its home base at Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he toured the South Lawn for the event, but he did step into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said, "I have three of them."
Every year “Saving Lives” grants will be allocated for the emergency care departments and intensive care units of the capital’s medical clinics.
According to the capital’s mayor, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the biggest in Moscow today.
In addition to an emergency care department and an inpatient unit, there is also an outpatient care unit here.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 ha.
Advanced medical equipment is used during surgery, which makes it possible to significantly reduce the period of rehabilitation for patients.
In just the first six months of this year, inpatient medical care was provided to 36,000 patients at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The clinic’s medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of difficulty.

Let us remember that the EU found an unusual method for getting rid of migrants.
Jazz at Skolkovo: experimentation and improvisation
Jazz and science are related concepts and it is no accident that they were connected, the people’s artist explained to Izvestia.
Jazz musicians value experimentation and improvisation as highly as scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be a performance by Azekel, a British citizen of Nigerian descent, who is known for both his own body of work and for his collaborative work with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
Jazz lovers are eagerly awaiting the first performance in Russia by the five-time Grammy nominated pianist, Christian Sands (USA), with his trio.
One of the most unusual festival performances promises to be the set by Sergei Kuryokhin award winner, Anton Maskeliadze.
The experimental artist conducts music and video using gestures: this is how leap motion technology works.
In total, eight musical groups will perform on two festival stages.

Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"We respect all clubs.
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
Today, I would like to hear how work is progressing.
In particular, I am asking for a report on how things stand in terms of compensation paid to affected citizens.
Putin was accompanied by the Plenipotentiary Representative of Russian President for the Siberian Federal District, Sergey Meniailo, and the head of the Baikal branch of the Federal State Budgetary Institution, Glavrybvod, Leonid Mikhailik.
First, Putin released several fry from a net.

The second largest food retailer in terms of revenue, Magnit, announced the opening of three new format test stores, Magnit-Opt, which are designed for small wholesale purchasing.
Metro Cash & Carry and Selgros Cash & Carry are already operating in the small-scale wholesale segment.
In 2017, Lenta launched the special program, Lenta Pro: it offered legal entities and independent business owners the ability to make purchases at the big box store’s special checkouts, and receive an invoice for cost accounting and VAT reimbursement.
The government of Orenburg Oblast also acted in a similar manner.
There, in the town of Novotroitsk, a priority social and economic development area will also be created.
Novotroitsk was the first single-industry town in Orenburg Oblast to receive the priority development area status.

In Moscow, a police officer injured a man in the leg while defending against an assault
A police officer shot a party to a fight in Moscow in the leg after that individual came after him with a piece of glass in his hand.
