Four members of the Kemerovo group arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, police in Spain have arrested Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world by the name of Slava Kemerovsky.
Yesterday the court also ordered that three suspects detained in Estonia be held.
In the Mijas province of Malaga in Spain, the alleged boss of a criminal organization was detained.
Verte emphasized that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has played an important part throughout the investigation.
Head of the central criminal police division Ago Leis said that the arrests were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted almost a year a half.
Leis added that central criminal police officials assisted in the Spanish arrests.
For years now, we have had good contacts and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil guard forces.
In 2005, Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of last decade, he was considered to rank second in the Estonian criminal world after the underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, who is from Kemerovo, became prominent in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he became involved in extortion in Tallinn.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.
Hepatitis: what should everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis – inflammation of the liver – may be caused by any of five hepatitis viruses – A, B, C, D and E.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of liver tissue.
Health Board epidemiology advisor Kuulo Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation – fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, greyish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowness of skin and mucous membranes.
In children, hepatitis can progress without symptoms.
Kutsar notes the different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us through eating of contaminated food or drinking of water, during sex, contact between hands and faeces from infected people and from hands to food, surfaces, objects, through contact with the mouth, and drug use.
Among the risk group for hepatitis A infection are family members and caregivers, people with chronic liver diseases, sex partners of infected people, men who have sex with men, drug abusers, and travellers to countries with a high incidence of hepatitis A.
Hepatitis B viruses spread through contact with the blood from a sick person, drug injecting, tattooing, piercing, use of everyday items contaminated with blood (toothbrushes, shaving accessories), donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from mother infected with hepatitis to a foetus/newborn.
Among the risk group for hepatitis B infection are drug abusers, sex partners of infected persons, men who have sex with men, infected mother to a newborn, family members and caregivers of the sick, healthcare, rescue and police workers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis B.
Hepatitis C viruses spread from exposure to the blood of a sick person, drug injecting, tattooing, piercing, use of everyday items contaminated with blood, donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis and from a mother sick with hepatitis to foetus/newborn.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Hepatitis D viruses spread through exposure to blood and other bodily fluids, syringes and needles contaminated with blood and other bodily fluids, sexual transmission and, rarely, from infected mother to foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic carriers of hepatitis D virus and people who lack immunity to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from hepatitis D infection.
Although challengers tried to crowd out the four-time Olympic champion in the final lap, 34-year-old Farah dug deep on the home stretch and won with a time of 26:49.51.
I really miss my family.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O’Connor’s Lady in Gold. The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, delves a good bit deeper into the late 19th and early 20th century history of Vienna cultural life.
Right now, it’s as if two books were inside one cover: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer depicted in his painting The Lady in Gold and a much larger and more sweeping history book of distinguished Jewish families and the German occupation and its aftereffects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads us into the vibrant Viennese cultural life – and anyone who has been to the Austrian capital will have little trouble imagining what life was like more than a hundred years ago around the Ringstrasse or how all heads turned in the Central Café when Klimt entered.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the closing decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the biggest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, one in ten Vienna residents was Jewish.
Adele’s parents as well were newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married a Czech sugar magnate twice her age, Ferdinand Bloch, and posed for the Klimt’s famous paintings, her father’s bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to commission a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the latter was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Anne-Marie O’Connor – Lady in Gold.
The extraordinary story behind the Gustav Klimt masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before starting work with Adele, Klimt had been to the San Vitale Basilica in Ravenna and scholars believe that it was the brilliant mosaics of the empress Theodora he saw there that gave the artist the idea of creating a golden portrait of Adele in the form of a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his Lady in Gold in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (1907-1908) another golden painting called Kiss was conceived.
How is Hitler tied in to the story?
“I think that in memory of my friend Klimt, I am in his debt that I should make his handiwork accessible to the public;” Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of Belvedere Museum a few years after the demise of the artist (Klimt died in February 1918) and expressed the wish that their family’s Klimt collection pass to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had painted another portrait of Adele.
In her testament as well (Adele died in February 1925), she asked that her husband leave her two portraits and four Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
She left her jewellery to her nieces Maria and Luise.
A year after Klimt finished work on the “Austrian Mona Lisa,” the 17-year-odl Adolf Hitler had striven for admission to the Vienna fine Art Academy, but failed his drawing examination.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to Jewish professors not admitting him to the academy, in fact none of his examiners was a Jew.
Even if you don’t plan to go see works by Klimt, after closing the book, at least my own emotions revolved around Nazi and Jewish themes more than the painting sold for 135 million dollars and the model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
Gold was just over half a second off Alina Kendzior’s Estonian record (2:15.13).
In Estonia’s all-time rankings, Gold rose to third and her latest personal best is the fifth all-time Estonian result.
Last week, the Canadian junior championships were held in Toronto, and Gold had successful starts there as well.
Only the record-setting Estonian Elina Partõka has swum the distance faster than Gold.
Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than her, has swum the distance just one hundredth of a second faster.
Donald Trump goes on holiday, critics sharpen their teeth
USA Today and CNN report that the president plans to spend his 17-day holiday at the golf club named after him in Bedminster, which is located in New Jersey.
Namely, the president is in the habit of spending the weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump in his 196 days in office has not taken the most vacation time of any president.
But Trump does tend to forget things quickly.
Just a few days after becoming president, Trump told 60 Minutes that he would not have time for long vacations during his term in office, as there is so much to be done.
It is being official called a working vacation instead, during which Trump will have no time to read or other favourite activities.
Namely, the air conditioning ion the West Wing of the White House is being replaced and thus all staff had to move out.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.
I'm happy with how it's going so far."
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
Polygamy is common here.
In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.
There is no public transport.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.
As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.
Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
"I have been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.
The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically backed the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.
It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.
In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.
The spring saw the Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium go on sale, and new hit smartphones are awaited on shelves in the autumn.
These four top models of smartphones will go on sale only this autumn.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach stores already in mid-September.
Rumours are rife about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it.
Apple’s design chief JonyIve requires that the new iPhone model look like smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
Pre-ordering of the brand-new Galaxy Note 8 begins on 23 August.
Many rumours have been leaked about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
We expect an edge-to-edge 5.3-inch screen, a blazingly fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a longer battery life.
Sony’s stable flagship has been the XZ Premium to this point, but the manufacturer has said that in the near future at least two smartphones with even more innovative functions will be added.
We’ll get to see quite soon what the reality will be, as traditionally, Sony has released its autumn flagship at the IFA international tech fair, which runs from 1-6 September this year.
Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.
The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.

A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.
Whenever they're ready ... ."
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended residence permits for a record more than 13,000 third-country nationals who have mainly travelled to Estonia to pursue work, studies or for family.
Government offices can’t say how many immigrants will end up staying in Estonia permanently, but the Ministry of the Interior is working on such an analysis.
Whereas ten years ago, about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia, this number has been approaching 2,000 in recent years.
Last year and the year before last, the number of Ukrainians who have received a temporary residence permit was even greater than the number of Russian citizens, even though more the most temporary residence permits have been issued to the latter during the last ten years.
“Considering the historical Russian community here, this they have likely the closest family ties to people living in Russia,” said Academy of Security Sciences migration researcher Helina Maasing.
“If we look at where Russian citizens who have received an Estonian residence permit have settled, Ida-Viru County comes right after Harju County,” she added and noted that 40 per cent of them are married to EU citizens.
Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
“The jump is because instead of extending residence permits, they have applied for a new residence permit for permanently settling in Estonia,” said interior ministry press representative Rammus, who said interest among Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has tended to be stable for years.
As of last year, foreign nationals who have lived here at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanently settling in Estonia.
Now Ukrainians can change their employer and the Estonian state no longer keeps close tabs on whether the salary criterion is fulfilled.
This residence permit became popular at one stroke – applicants last year also included grey passport holders (1,029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In the first half-year of this year, the total number of such applicants has already reached 1,269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become the country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mainly due to study migration.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, North Korea, and just as many from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
In total, according to Statistics Estonia, 14,822 people immigrated to Estonia, and 13,792 emigrated.
For that reason, the migration balance for Estonian citizens was negative 2,000 last year.
Estonians migrate between Finland and Estonia the most.
Mammu Couture princess fashion entices with frills, embroidery and tulle.
If you do something with passion, you study and learn from it every day.
It isn’t her fault that she doesn’t live in Hollywood and doesn’t walk the red carpet every day; she wants to wear the prettiest dresses, and does wear them!
The Mammu collection was showcased in Võru, in Jõhvi and along the fashion street in Pärnu, where a regal column of 45 models filled the entire street.

Martin Müürsepp on U18 boys: the Estonian tournament’s weapon now was turned against us
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn’t set up the defence.
Müürsepp said Estonia should have committed more fouls to nip the opponents’ momentum in the bud.
Müürsepp said he was satisfied with his charge on the Kalev squad, Matthias Tass.
It’s too bad that we hadn’t met such aggressive opponents before
In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.
By the end of the game, Poland was shooting 33% from the field; and Estonia, 13% (9 out of 68).
NATO ships come to Tallinn to replenish stores
Today, NATO Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1 arrived in Tallinn for a weekend port call to replenish ships’ stores and prepare for an upcoming exercise.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be prepared for future operations to search for historical ordnance.
“Estonians’ participation in the NATO unit and the interoperability exercise in local waters typifies our integrated allied forces,” said Capt. Maj. Arto Reinmaa, the operations and planning division commander in the capacity of commander of the naval fleet.
Starting 29 June, NATO Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1 is headed by Latvian naval Capt. Lt. Gvido Laudups, who took over the functions of group commander from Estonian naval officer Capt. Lt. Johan Elias Seljamaa at a ceremony held in Riga.
This half-year, the Estonian minesweeper Sakala is also part of the international unit.
As one of four groups of ships subordinate to the NATO naval command, Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1 is a response unit that is among the primary rapid responders, which the alliance can deploy in various places around the world in five days.
From 4-13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Convent again turn into the venue for the Birgitta Festival started 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klas.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic Risto Joost, 36.
Risto Joost: Listeners will hear opera classics La Traviata and Tosca, see ballet performances from Bolero to “Karlsson” and there’s even an in-production in the programme, which this time will be a performance of Joseph Haydn’s wonderful oratorio The Seasons by the same international creative team that brought another Haydn masterpiece to the stage at Pirita in 2015, The Creation.
It is bigger than any other musical theatre in its conventional form.
Because the experience that listeners get in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human spirits resonate and touches human senses in a way that can’t be described.
Risto, it is your first year as artistic director of the Birgitta Festival.
Maybe thanks to this it is easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and naturally it all spreads to me as well.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work.
It was Eri Klas’s big heart that gave me energy to go ahead with Birgitta Festival in the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And a curious twist is that the ballet is by Latvian composer Juris Karlsons and it was his idea to write it.
Risto, how do you find the energy for everything?
This kind of work needs a support system and much love and fortunately I have that in spades.
Watch the enjoyable video with Risto Joost!
Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.
They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.
To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."
In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.
The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."
One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.

The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
If it wasn’t enough that the electric car revolution is transforming everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it is also creating new winners and losers on the metals market.
Glencore currently makes money on coal and oil, but in future, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow in the electric car age.
“It will change everything with regard to some metals,” Capital Economics commodities analyst Simona Gambranini told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on such metals as cobalt and lithium whose demand has grown for years.
There is even more copper in charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas believes it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries will mean additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will derive income from the growing electric car trend from the rise in copper prices, and the fact that it is the world’s biggest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group has forecasted.
This brokerage believes that Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals will be other winners from the ascendancy of electric cars.
Last year’s price rise was 37 per cent.
Copper, too, is up 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore shares rose 20 per cent in London, outstripping rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American in its increase.
The main end use of lead is in batteries that provide current to the starters of petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
Lead has increased in price by 17 per cent this year, being the biggest gainer among industrial metals in London.
This makes up 2.7 per cent of the total world aluminium production.
Aluminium has increased in price by 13 per cent this year, as growing demand from auto makers has led to a market deficit.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop lighter steel alloys to compete with aluminium.
“Ultrastrong steel should be the answer to this development,” said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
The end of the oil era can lead to tribulations for platinum as well.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used for catalytic converters in diesel cars,” said metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
“Many commodities in high demand such as oil and platinum may not necessarily have high demand in future,” said commodities analyst for Natixis, Bernard Dahdah.
This doesn’t mean that commodities as a whole will become less important but their importance will change over the next 15 years.
Platinum producers believe there will be continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
“Diesel appears to be the clear loser on the way to electric cars,” said Brunet from Exane BNP Paribas.
How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.
Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.

The hurricane, called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage above all in Lääne County, Harju County and Rapla County.
The wind speed in northwestern Estonia on those days was over 30 m/s.
Roofs were already flying off the houses yonder, recalled an older woman, Linda Kurova of Haapsalu, in an interview with the magazine Eesti Loodus in 2002.
Compared to Lääne County, Lääne-Viru County did not sustain particularly severe damage compared to the August storm of 1967, but the losses were high there, too, Virumaa Teataja reported in 2007.
Haapsalu castle park and Padise park were wiped off the face of the earth, but parks in our area also sustained heavy damage.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured at as much as 35 metres per second – in other words, about 130 kilometres per hour.
The Põlli Manor building in Viljandi County was so badly damaged by the storm that it was decided later to raze it.
The secret of clean beaches: nightly cleanup and poor beach weather
Seagulls shriek at Stroomi Beach in North-Tallinn.
People still come to the beach regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If it’s nice weather, people are at the beach, and if it isn’t, there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, the head of cleaning operations for the private company Haabersti Haldus.
Usov has been on duty since four o’clock.
Besides Stroomi, he also watches over Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljassaare Pikakari beach.
The amounts of rubbish have decreased.
Years ago, there was a lot more of it.
The price of a clean beach
That is how much waste is generated.
“Usually more of them emerge, but this is a normal yield.” Usov already knows that soon he will find them in the sand again.
Rubbish is spread around
In one month, the beach has to be sifted twice.
But the goal is to get an international blue flag for Stroomi, similarly to Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu.
“Compared to the rest of Europe, there is a lot more work in Estonia to keep the beaches maintained,” says Scholler.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.
In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.
The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.
The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000
Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.
Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
We warmly welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'
This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
The price of electricity rose 12% in Estonian, while it dropped in Latvia and Lithuania.
In Estonia, the average power exchange price of electricity last month shaped up to be 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour and the price rose by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price on Nord Pool power exchange was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose 12 and seven per cent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity flowed to Estonia in 75% of the hours last month and from Estonia to Finland in 16% of the hours.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity flowed from Estonia to Latvia 99% of the time and during 73% of the hours, the entire transmission capacity was in use.
According to the transactions executed on the last trading day in July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the power exchange price electricity may end up being around 34 and in September 37 euros per megawatt-hour.
The price of carbon dioxide, which impacts the power generation price, rose last month and transactions were conducted at a price of 5.04 to 5.47 euros per tonne.
Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."

"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.
No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.

In July, Bank of Estonia bought 149 million euros in bonds as part of the central banks’ government asset programme, and the central bank’s bond portfolio grew to a total of 4.36 billion euros.
Bank of Estonia President Ardo Hansson had previously explained in response to an interpellation from MPs that Eurozone central banks’ asset purchase programme encompasses three different buying programmes: covered bonds, asset backed securities (ABS) and public sector purchase programme (PSPP).
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Bank of Estonia executes what are called substitute purchases in the amount allocated to it.
The Bank of Estonia has been purchased bonds as part of the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the interim, Elering bonds were purchased, but as of June 2016, the Bank of Estonia no longer buys Elering bonds.
The Finnish central bank buys both Elering and Eesti Energia bonds on behalf of the Eurozone’s central banks.

Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.
European Union flags will be purchased for Estonian schools for 20,000 euros.
A total of 570 educational institutions will receive European Union flags measuring 105 x 158 cm.
The flagpole label bears a text: “Gift to Estonian schools for recognizing the first Estonian presidency of the Council of the European Union.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.
They relied on his routine.
His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting one's instincts.
The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.
If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.
Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.

The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'
The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."
They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.
"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."

On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge employee happiness at her e-commerce start-up, but surveys weren't working.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"It just never had consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
By building and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, they allow companies to do snap polls, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistle-blowers to bypass C-suite executives and go straight to the board of directors.
"You've now got tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Companies are coming to realize they must stay on top of their workplace culture, lest they become the next Uber, which has been enmeshed in scandal since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for oversight is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to finance tech insights website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colo., start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an uptick in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's fall into disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, gather confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of its problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous texting hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and offer an easy way to reach its corporate headquarters.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way of tracking employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, though, problems that were previously hidden from executives who sat in offices cities or states away - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the employment experience," said Vitrano, who oversees Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
"Prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees to use their products.
It's a business model and opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors, who have propped up both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital raised to $47 million.
Glint secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments hardly come as a surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are merely table stakes.
"When people are happy to be at a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding backing.
Having data on employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and make employees disengaged.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow through, employees will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?' "
And, after gathering feedback from employees frustrated by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are quickly approaching the affluent countries of Western Europe in terms of income, Bloomberg wrote, citing a report from the European Central Bank.
According to the ECB, starting in 1999, the per capital GDP in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Although the objective is for per capita gross domestic product to become equal to the wealthier Western Europe, in 2015 per capital gross domestic product in the Baltic economies was just 2/3 of the average among the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year as well, local residents are far from enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only one-quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents felt that their economies were doing well or fairly well.
"This is a grind for these guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said not long before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA's elimination of two-a-day practices, designed to lighten the load on players, has actually lengthened their days - at least until finals end Friday.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through Aug. 20 before beginning formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&M on Sept.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change even if it did add another item to players' busy itineraries.

This year marks 30 years since her first research trip to Siberia.
Since that time, she has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many Setos migrated from Siberia at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century to get land here?
I say 8,000.
For example, in New Pechory, many Setos went to work later in the closed city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (which is where the Soviet regime built a uranium plant – J. P.) once it was established.
They brought with them a great many folk costumes.
For example in Setomaa, meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.

At least until such time that a decision has been taken to declare Estonia GMO-free,” said the head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs, Sigmar Suu.
“At the same time, it must be taken into consideration that the measures developed must serve the required purpose, be proportional, and take into account the expenses and administrative burden of both private and public sector,” added Suu.
Specifically in connection with apiculture, the current obligation of GM crop growers to notify beekeepers of commencement of growing GM crops will be supplanted with the obligation to achieve, before commencing growing of such crops, a corresponding agreement with the beekeeper.
All parties have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with it in the draft legislation information system and if desired, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.

Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started the 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final preseason game before the Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marauded forward at will.
As well as Matic, fellow new signings Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho started to shape his starting XI for the start of the season.
According to bird watcher Mati Martinson, who lives on Sõrve peninsula, the first young crane to get a transmitter was tagged in Sõrve, and this brood is already flying around, has left the nest area and joined the large population roosting on Mullutu-Suurlaht bay.
This is because Sõrve does not have any fields of grain, Saarte Hääl reports.
Martinson says the radio tagging is actually an international project, led by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year one crane named Mati got a GSM radio tag in Türju on Sõrve peninsula.
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, access his office and even start his car with just a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and finger and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to a medical standard.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted for cats and dogs, and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also alter locks on houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, for a cost of £300 each lock.
The married father of one now has technology fitted to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House Prop Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000, according to military records released to TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House showcasing American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for the "unusual" event, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because it's such an unusual high visibility event," the commander of HMX-1 emailed his superior, the Marine Deputy Commandant for Aviation, the day before the event.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft while it was the ground.
It was not clear from records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 inquired about whether the event might violate the provision.
Using the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made In America' showcase that featured products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
Unit helicopters also flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
HMX-1 doesn't maintain budgetary records for presidential flights, and determining the precise cost incurred by the event is difficult.
But according to Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The White House argues the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"These rate estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do account for fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
"The idea is to showcase this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to our national security, that there are, I assume, hundreds if not thousands of people whose job depends on that.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's appropriate to highlight that."
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.

GMB concern over investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent over the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner Pladis said it had invested more than £5m at the site in the last few years.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "address concerns that funding is not being brought forward for the modernisation of production lines."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the general site manager over the business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross is deeply concerning our members.
So, from the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie's."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The site manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will be responding directly as we value ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We discussed with employees then that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we review our operations on an ongoing basis - and that applies across our all our businesses and sites - in order to remain competitive.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any changes to our operations at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about move for Neymar three years ago?
La Liga side may rue their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after lodging a £189m offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has lit up the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club ready to break the world transfer record by more than double the previous mark, which saw Paul Pogba return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
Once completed, the move will see Neymar become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world, with PSG offering wages of over £500,000-a-week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with the manner of the approach and the way that Neymar has forced his way out, despite a source close to the Catalans' board insisting that the club have always done their best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing an interesting in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could well be feeling the repercussions of that interest by losing one of their prize assets in Neymar.
“Brexit seriously threatens to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland as well as between Great Britain and Ireland,” Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the current freedom of movement of people and goods, he said.
Varadkar said he would prefer Great Britain to remain part of the European Union, or since this is not possible, to remain part of the European Single market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the exit of Britain smoother would be to establish a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish prime minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: “Certainly we could have such an agreement with Great Britain.”
Among others, Märt Avandi who triumphantly completed his first triathlon ever.
Avandi has been training hard since February.
Although Avandi was behind both Raio Piiroja (4:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (5:06:37), he did beat the other competitors in the “celebrity” category.
Tanel Padar, featured as a “good role model” last year, was seven minutes behind Avandi (5:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan was 16 minutes behind (5:50:23), and Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm nearly an hour behind (6:31:53 and 6:45:18, respectively).
The overall winner on the men’s side of the Otepää round of the Ironman series was the German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27, and Ivo Suur was the best among the Estonians with a time of 4:14:09.
Among the women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 4:24:01, and of the Estonians, Maria Jänese, who was close to half an hour behind Frederiksen with a time of 4:58:58.
Avandi covered the 1.9 km swimming distance in a time of 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410th place.
