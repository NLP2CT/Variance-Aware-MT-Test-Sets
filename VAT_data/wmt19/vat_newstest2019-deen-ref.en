Hvar with its flirting, coquetting, and seduction is not an easy task for our girls.
There is an open question so you get into a conversation, you talk to him about why you have apparently felt that way, how is stated in his statement, said Grindel in football Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".
The 29-year-old had declared that he quits DFB team in July and explained it with the fact that Grindel did not protect him against racist hostility during the World Cup.

There is still a diesel taskforce, said Peter Mertens, chief development officer from the ‘Automobilwoche’ trade journal.
Currently the Sales Director Bram Schot heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Officer.
After conversion to the new emissions and consumption standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audi, Schot told the ‘Heilbronner Stimme’.
Essentially, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
Schot is for electromobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric automobile.
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism directed at him personally following the early FIFA World Cup exit and the scandal around Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as President of the DFB again in the coming year.
I do my work and try to make it as good as it gets, said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning on ZDF’s weekly sports broadcast "Das aktuelle Sportstudio".
A re-election should be attempted and that is what I will do.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 2024.
According to Grindel, the future head organizer of the 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, is to join the DFB Presidential Board.
At the same time, he did not want to speculate as to whether or not Lahm could succeed him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the scandal over the photos taken by Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a preference for a national team player without an immigration background to fill the position of DFB ambassador for integration.
Currently, this position is filled by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who traces her family back to Cameroon.

Basketball Bundesliga: Clear success for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new German Basketball League season with a sound victory.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won coach Ainars Bagatskis’ competitive debut with 84-80 (39-37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83:76 (41:34).
New international Karim Jallow was the most accurate thrower with 24 points in coach John Patrick’s team .
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season successfully.
Basketball Löwen Braunschweig had a clear victory with 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings dominated the Oldenburg team with 25 points.
The Braunschweig team, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the season started, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run tells it all.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite adherents of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
Inner city Cologne was partially blocked for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Global Citizen Festival: Music against poverty: Stars, boos and scary moments
Get involved wherever you can, said Mendes on Sunday evening at the festival in front of approximately 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming, this is a dream.
There was a short panic with people running in all directions.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge online.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases online.
Freedom of Press: Federal government defends exclusion of journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said to the Bild on Sunday.
It was about a disruption in the course of the press conference.
In Turkey, many journalists are imprisoned.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the incarcerated journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
His fans normally know him to be so fresh and good looking: Florian David Fitz.
Hamburg - The talk show “Inas Nacht” [Ina's Night] produced by NDR is known for its cheery conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub “Schellfischposten.”
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
The bed selfie showed a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Night.
And Spritz.
And also pass on Ina’s round of eggnog at half past two."
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
Accessing the 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very difficult and heavily littered.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - so for quite some time presents itself the entrance with seating area to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The sight of the bicycle path, which is the flagship object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
The matter is of concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have also taken interest for some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
There is no solution so far.
I think, the latter would be the order of the day, irrespective of any further activities, says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) says he also brought the issue up with the local advisory council.
However, this would require a police patrol to come out.
In principle, Wüstenhagen supports the development of the Haaße hill.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be critically dangerous.
There is no turning lane on Haaße Hügel.
In fact, it soon became a familial togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Particularly popular places were the Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
The Kulturbahnhof was also mentioned.
It’s not about winning, Franke had said.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the “Lummerland pack:” “a very good performance” with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Trade Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The players form two teams and sit opposite one another.
This ensures the other side cannot read anything unintentionally.
3. Cube.
These are the terms that need to be coded.
Taking turns, one player per team is the encryptor.
In "Decrypto," it is not the words behind the secret film that should be guessed, but their encryption codes.
So the term should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy. Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
But once you have started, you’ll be amazed at how much emotion there is in this nondescript game.
And if it's all about guessing and not about winning, it's easy to play a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man gives police the Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the upper town, later he was also found in the upper town in a pub where he harassed other guests.
After clearly under the influence of alcohol he did not comply with the police order to vacate the premises, he had to spend the night in the detention cell in the police station of Kulmbach.
The Pressig depotwas home to the thrust locomotives
For decades the depot in Pressig was the hub of the Franconian Forest.
1991 put an end to a piece of railway history.
The crashing from bumper to bumper could be heard throughout Pressig, remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the stations.
This did not bother anybody.
The squeaking of brakes and rattling of carriages could also be heard.
This was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkel’s Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in the Franconian forest has a place been characterized by the railway so much.
The centerpiece was the turntable, which after reconstruction in the year 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres, says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader with 47 years of experience.
The Pressig depot, which in the year 1968 was relocated to Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the track in 1939 reduced the need for pulling trains and locomotives.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here, remembers Georg Dinkel.
On June 1, 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to a change in the hierarchy of both locations and how many more historical and current pictures there are, is included here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with initial success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing, just as Julia Görges before.
Next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Carla Suárez Navarro from Spain.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Daria Kassatkina, when the Russian athlete on rank 13 gave up.
The Swabian will now face Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
On the weekend as part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach.
Organisers and visitors showed great relief that the weather conditions were ideal for the special vernissage of the "Windspiel-Performance" which took place in the open air on the Dahlmann-Schmidt property in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" (Around Walberla) in the framework of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened its doors for the 15th year.
The large number of visitors showed the fascination with the exhibits.
21 exhibits from 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have helped in designing flyers.
The visitor quickly understands when walking through the spacious garden that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental and prefers to dedicate three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway through the path Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind" (The Wind the Heavenly Child).
The special exhibition can be viewed until December 31, 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
And also the people of Albachten demonstrated their anger.
It has become a legend by now: At a bank in Tinnenbusch, the MGV 68 came to existence.
There are 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singer.
They had revived the foundation festival especially for the anniversary.
It became an elegant ball and formal clothing had been requested beforehand.
Of course, the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten would let their voices sound.
Matching the occasion, happy songs were quite fitting.
The choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in Tinnenbusch back then, was once again very confident.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodic poetry.

No trace of shyness or getting the heebie-jeebies. The independents are doing their thing.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
Ultimately USC made everything clear with its experienced players and finished it out.
After just three matchdays, it does not seem foreseeable where the independents’ journey goes.

Trendsport ensures record numbers of visitors to Braunschweig this weekend
The very popular supporting program was an important factor.
According to information to date, on Sunday shortly before noon a motorist had ignored the right of way of another driver in the Coburger Straße.
The cars collided.
The total of four injured were taken to a hospital with the ambulance.
Traffic obstructions resulted.
Emergency assistance from the Hildburghausen fire department cleared the accident site.
Glider crashes - student pilot crashed fatally
On Sunday afternoon, the single-seated aircraft crashed during landing in a parking lot near the airport Essen-Mülheim, said a police spokesman on Sunday in Essen.
The cause of the crash was not clear - the weather was good, there was a slight wind and sunshine.
Essen/Mülheim is a small airport, which is frequently used by pilots with light private planes.
This could also have been a reason.
Because this work became a part of me, I traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues treated me as equal, explained Keller in the interview to "Bild am Sonntag".
Because now journalists called her only as Heide Keller.
The marriage to von Borsody failed as well.
Why did it never work out with men?
Keller was in love at that time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not compatible with daily life.
And the shiny glare, in which a green carpet is bathed in, on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.
So this late Thursday evening he tottered across the square, to briefly relieve himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is being premiered at the festival: The public convenience on the ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard to create a luxurious ambience.
What do you have to come up with when writing an article about this festival, so as not to fall into hidden advertising for its 190 partner companies.

In the delicatessen in the basement oysters await slurping mouths, nearby the unparalleled Culatello di Zibello raw ham is freshly cut, and a chocolate fountain bubbles.
Its main character will not be far away.
He is not talked into, not gaped at, at the most he receives stealthy glances.
This restraint, easily mistaken for inhibition, is why the international stars love this film festival.

Handball: Association League 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute loss
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball club ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat.” His protégés were “devastated” after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) failure - the fourth in four games - Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
Over long periods, they had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly.
But then suddenly a jolt went through the team, summarized Bieletzki.
At halftime, they were only two goals behind.
Senden's best player, Marius Hintze, kept scoring in phase one.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized for 15-15.
The impartial got in on the action.
Bieletzki usually does not seek blame with others.
LIT had an opportunity and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
Now it must be a damned victory, said Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
Response services dug up a street on Saturday near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers were removed below, as police and prosecutors announced.
According to new findings, the missing woman may have been buried not far from her former home.
Investigators at the time did not rule out foul play.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators discovered a conspicuous feature under the road in Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
In addition, security updates, such as those for Windows, should be quickly installed and there is no harm in equipping computers with anti-virus protection.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled a lawsuit out of court regarding misleading Tweets in which Musk could have lost his ability to manage listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla are each paying 20 million US dollars. In addition, Musk is giving the office of chairman up for three years.
He may stay CEO, though.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC has sued the world-famous manager in the US federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
That would have valued Tesla at 72 billion dollars.
Musk later backpedaled: Tesla remains a listed company.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1:1 against Chelsea FC

Survey: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the quarrels of recent weeks, the grand coalition conceded several poll low blows.
Berlin - For the first time the AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the polling institute, the AfD has gained one point and holds 17 percent, the SPD, compared to the previous week, has lost a point and holds 16 percent.
Also CDU and CSU lose a point and hold only 27 percent.
So far this is the lowest rating for the Union in the Sunday trend.
If on Sunday were the Bundestag election, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only receive 43 percent of the votes according to Emnid.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, 44 percent against.
In the case of the unionists, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.

Football: District League: Strong appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives hope
There were moments in this young season, when Alois Fetsch was really hard on his team.
Silently, the coach of the football district league club VfL Wolbeck first retreated (inwardly) to ponder over the lack of motivation on the playing field.
All is history.
Meanwhile, the game is on at Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine proved so, and they almost got promoted past season.
That was something to be proud of, praised Fetsch his boys and went to each of his players individually after the game to simply say "thank you" for the great defense against the ambitious guests.
After halftime, VfL boldly took complete control.
Thewes just barely failed with a shot from 18 meters.
Schroer was too late in minute 58 when Thewes passed him the ball.
Fetsch decided to freshen up the team on the left wing and put in Miles Geske.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Westhues in minute 70, the home team got an indirect free kick 18 meters away from the goal.
With 20 minutes left on the clock, the game seemed to last forever.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Wolbeck had to endure long minutes in the final stage, when Geske finally managed to finally get that ball into the goal and secure the winning goal in minute 87.
That might have been overkill.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th minute Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th minute L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th minute Geske) - Thewes

Füchtorf's Home Association celebrates a major festival: The milk comes after the apple
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused a big amount of interest.
Every now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg had help from the children to fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer, which looked a bit like chopped shreds.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a big vessel.
But the Füchtorf farmer also had bottled specialties with him.
There was a lot of demand for the good “Made in Füchtorf” beverage.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited people to join in fun games at several stations.
The Home Association will also offer an action day next year.
That is also obvious because of the topic: Because then, it will all be about milk.
Frankfurt / Main After their fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed players from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
Victory continues to elude the players from Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86.) scored to narrow the gap. They remain at the bottom of the table with only two points and must be considered a relegation candidate in their current form.
By contrast, an excellent Ante Rebic led Frankfurt to celebrate their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored for the DFB Cup winners in front of 46,300 spectators. After the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio, Frankfurt move into the middle of the table on seven points.
Croatia’s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive move by the Hessians at his starting eleven debut while Hannover’s defense struggled to reign him in.
The striker battered after the World Cup, showed by his tempo and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was called up to Frankfurt’s starting eleven for the first time and the team got off to a dynamic start.
The first sign of danger came in the form of Lucas Torró’s header (17th), which was deflected into the netting.
The home side’s lead was all but inevitable and completely justified.
After a defended corner kick, Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the box and Haller headed it in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to tap it in.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender from French second division team AJ Auxerre who had joined the club during the summer.
This time, Haller passed to his fellow striker Rebic, who skillfully dribbled through the lines leaving 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time Hannover Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt, two new attackers.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour Rebic started a solo and then crossed to De Guzmán, who just tapped the ball into the empty goal.

All in all, the new residential home on Münsterblickstrasse houses 30 people with disabilities on almost 1,500 square meters, divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are paid union wages.

99 documents reflect Austria's eventful history
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, takes a very different approach in the magnificent "picture book" of Austria, which will be published on October 1.
First of all, however, conflict-laden topics are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labor immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off lightly with an exchange premium - SPD and CDU consider the manufacturers to be under obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
There will be disputes amongst the coalition partners again - how could this be otherwise?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the grand coalition, but three partners with sometimes very different images of society and priorities.
Dispute is good.
But to be constructive, dispute should not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons regarding the question of being or not-being.
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and confidence thereby regained.
Above all, that is what the people's parties must now fight for.

Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Complete helplessness: Goalless match between FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen
Rot-Weiß Ahlen still going nowhere.
The tail light and the third last of the league demonstrated complete helplessness in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald stadium.
Responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal was Gütersloh’s Nick Flock in minute 28.
The best - and in principle only real - opportunity had the team from Ahlen, when FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz’ shot on goal from the edge of the penalty area in minute 32.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury. Sinan Aygün replaced him.
In minute 48, Sebastian Mützel shot just over the goal from 18 meters and after one hour the Gütersloh player also appeared offensive for the very first time.
After a ball recapture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, this was quickly dealt with.
Nick Flock (minute 62) "crowned" the quick counterattack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, substituting Martin Fuhsy for Marko Onucka (minute 60) and a little later Sebastian Mützel for Enes Güney (minute 70).
The team from Ahlen did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but that did not get them anywhere.
We were not as dangerous against goal in this match as against Holzwickede, even though our opponents did not want to play here, states RW Ahlen’s interim coach.
Offensively, "everything just happened somehow" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I did not feel that we could concede a goal," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, the viewer did not feel like his team could score a goal, either.
The performance was too poor for that.
That is good news for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann, and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld food bank, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers clarify: "These donations will remain in Reckenfeld."
At short notice, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stood in for the Brockmanns, who were to be weighed against food.
But there are enough Kreimers anyway.
And the "substitute" insisted on musically entertaining the ever increasing number of visitors.
This was so well received that people sang along to some folk songs late at night.

There are already pledges, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of schools, sports and culture, without naming names.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of a skate park.
He assumes a decision will be reached this year, so that park can be built in 2019.

The second team in the table, coached by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chances against Turin.
The top match was however decided at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Rui (58.).

We played well against a good Napoli, the Turin coach commented.
Emre Can should also feel addressed.
The German national has asserted himself at Juve.

Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for staying in the league.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes.
Top scorer Lars Zymner shot his team in the lead with his 12th. Goal this season (minute 24).

And then it went back and forth.

Satirical revue: Gender communication from the heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
Tina Teubner’s satirical revue Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable for adults as well as men".
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes even gets a word in before the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pianist: Süverkrüp accompanied Teubner congenially and in harmony, so much so that some may have wished a solo.
But that a closed door without a partner, on the other hand, offers no benefit.

Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have established themselves again in the top group of the 3. League West.
This is what we have been working towards, says trainer Dominik Münch excitedly after an almost flawless performance by his team at the now defeated table leader.

The 125th anniversary of the District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation was celebrated with a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29 1893 a fruit show in the Kulmbach community hall set the last impulses for the founding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association for Gardening and Landscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday night, the association celebrated the big anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle (civic centre).
Frankly the association had a different name at that time: In the year 1893 the mayor Wilhelm Flessa ammounced the name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (District Fruit Growing Association Kulmbach City and Country).
At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elite, explained the local history curator Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees lined the highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
But by far that is not the end of the scope.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" (moles) showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are.
In the old days everything came from the garden, for the winter conserves were made.
Also involved is the welcoming of new citizens to our associations, explained the President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl.

There is no hint of stage fright in the process.
In front of the stage, people dance to the powerful yet harmonious band performance.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate the variety within hard rock with their alternative sound, which is sometimes reminiscent of 1970s classic rock.
Among other titles, the yearning, almost ballad-like Take Me Home captivates the audience by switching between melodic passages and the guitar-heavy rock reefs typical of the multi-layered songs.
Meanwhile, the quartet The Ignition from Tönnishäuschen have earned a special reputation since the band formed in 2005.
It is obvious and unmistakable that The Ignition have a great deal of stage experience from their performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China tour.

Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US President is well disposed towards North Korea’s ruler Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
The tragic thing is: It is a long-distance relationship.
OK?
The US president seemed to be fully aware, that not everyone was fond of the affection for the notorious martial threats of the "Rocket Man" - so Trump’s nickname for Kim.
That is so unpresidential.
He cared little for that, said Trump, pointing his finger at the crowd: "I always told you, it is so easy to be presidential."

Foreign Minister Ri calls for a concession from Washington.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the UN General Debate, has accused the US government of stalling negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula through continued sanctions.
Disarmament under these circumstance would be unthinkable for North Korea.
The idea that North Korea could be ‘brought to its knees’ due to the sanctions, is ‘a pipe dream of people who don’t know us’.
However, the USA has shown no "corresponding reactions" to that, the minister criticised.
In recent days the US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict adherence to the sanctions at the United Nations.
Concurrently, the US government is working on a rapprochement.

Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Tafel had introduced a limit for foreigners.
He had resigned in July as vice-chairman of the NRW Tafel, said Sartor to the "Welt am Sonntag".

The Gladbachers, using the Swiss quartett line-up of Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave away the lead twice, but ultimately achieved a 2:2 score, which means that since the year 2003 they still await an away win in the VW city.
Renato Steffen was responsible for the 1:1 tie goal for Wolfsburg, which was his second goal in the Bundesliga.
The Aargauer Yann Sommer was powerless against the low shot from 20 metres, as well as against the second goal against an hour later.
