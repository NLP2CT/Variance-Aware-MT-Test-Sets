Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kep Atletico in check, the derby ended in a goalless draw
Courtois played three seasons in Atletico while on loan from Chelsea.

According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of the top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo who transferred to Juventus.
The US Senate is currently attempting to investigate, whether Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee for one of the nine members of the Supreme Court can be chosen for the job.
In the beginning of this strong documentary, we meet gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who is now, because of the law restrictions, the only Missouri state doctor providing abortions.
An armed guard at the clinic says he is defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
The news videos remind us about lethal terrorist attacks against the clinics.
Let us move to the time abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, an evangelical clergymen alliance directed women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is sound, but actually not really needed, a picture of a woman died of a self-made abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths a year in the United States.
The legalisation of abortions was defended especially by the Republican party.
Later it was precisely Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign who, in a revolutionary manner, began to mix religion with politics in order to draw voters.
And the same was done also by Donald Trump.
Religion has brought exceptional knots to politics.
While writing this, the situation in the United States is such that a president, who bragged about his sexual harassment but managed to win the votes of the religious Right with his stand on abortion, announced Kavanaugh as a nominee to the Supreme Court, who is now charged of sexual harassment by many women.
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months, as Israel has fired at the protesters in the border.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been wounded.

According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12,000 wounded.
Explosives sent from the Palestinian side strapped to kites and helium balls have started fires in Israeli forests and on cultivated land.
Teemu Pukki gained a penalty kick - didn't get to shoot it himself
Wigan's central defender Chey Dunkley seemed to tackle him from behind inside penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward let the game continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Pukki could not believe his eyes.
The incident probably was on referee Ward's mind, as he judged a penalty kick to Norwich on the 85th minute when Pukki was knocked down.
Ward showed the penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored the winning 1-0 goal.
Pukki has scored five times for Norwich in the Premier League.
The previous one was finished stylishly using his pectorals against QPR on last Saturday.
After he lost the ball, he carried on with the situation until its end.
This was Norwich's fifth match in two weeks.
It is estimated that about two per cent of men and a small part of women are at least somewhat attracted to pre-teens.
Those sexually attracted to children or young people have up to the present had a difficult time finding help.
Sexual attraction towards children causes shame to many.
Most of the people who have noticed paedophiliac feelings in themselves have not acted out their fantasies, thus committing no criminal acts.
Most of these people hope to be rid of the thoughts that cause distress and depress them.
They also make normal life more difficult, sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as an expert in the project, says to Yle.
Based on the odds, the biggest favourites for Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met this year already three times and promised to try to achieve peace treaty between the two countries.
The thaw in relations between the Koreas is remarkable, because as recently as last year the relations were frosty.
Even so, awarding a prize to Kim, who has for years threatened with nuclear weapons and who leads his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly cause criticism.
With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a terryifying by-product of many conflicts.
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered to be a strong candidate.
The names of the nominees are not made public.
Trump himself would not mind receiving a Nobel.
In May a reported asked him in White House, whether he feels he deserves a peace prize.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee who decide on the award, has often awarded the prize to people and organisations that represent liberal democracy and multipolar world order - exactly such international co-operation Trump has has been seen opposed to.
Awarding Trump would mean a complete ideological reversal for the Nobel Committee.

Ilves fans carried by lake ship M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay aboard and continue their victory celebration, even when the ship’s bow was stuck to the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted away from its route late Saturday evening, and its bow got stuck to the bottom of the lake in Akaa's Vanajavesi.
No one was hurt during the incident.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which Ilves won 4-3.
Syrjä said that the navigation was also complicated by the closest channel marking being covered by gull droppings, which meant its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn evening.
No noteworthy crash
According to Syrjä, there was no bigger drama involved in the event, because the ship's speed was very low at the time of the event, and hitting the bottom did not cause any significant crash.
A diver checked the ship condition on Saturday morning, before the ship was towed from the shoal.
Just to be on safe side, we are going to the dock to check this caused no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes the next M/S Tampere cruise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
Ambulances were sent to Viiala harbour to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
Trump's justice nominee accused of sexual assault and drinking may be left without the top position
Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Justice to the Supreme Court, may well be left without the position he is pursuing, estimates programme director Mika Aaltola from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
So far at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in his student days.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have created so much pressure on the Republican party that president Donald Trump may decide to nominate someone else for the position.
The nomination would benefit the Democrats
If Kavanaugh is nominated, Aaltola says it will most likely benefit the Democrats in the coming Congress midterm elections.
On the other hand, nominating a conservative Justice to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity for a nomination every presidential term, because the United States Supreme Court justices are nominated for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request around the age of 70 to 80.
Even some Republicans hesitate about the nomination
Even though Trump has set a time limit of only a week for the FBI’s further investigations, according to Aaltola it can still reveal something substantial.
Yes, it can.
There is rarely smoke without fire, Aaltola says.
The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination would be voted on, and the Republicans lost.

Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi made it to the finals in the closing day of Swimming World Cup's competition 3/7 in the Netherlands.
Earlier in September in Helsinki Pöytäkivi swam the Finnish record time 22.77 for this style and distance.

Now Theatre Academy takes the only complete classical trilogy, Oresteia by Aeschylus, to a tour that begins from the National Theatre.
This fourth production, just like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who resides in Berlin.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha’s adaptation of Oresteia laudably condenses the tale of how the curse upon the doomed House of Atreus is lifted and a constitutional state is formed to 80 minutes by condensing especially the chorus parts.
The playmanages to be quite faithful to the spirit of Kirsi Simonsuuri’s excellent translation (2003).
The performance utilises both double and triple portrayals of the main roles.
Of course the performance does not even claim to be faithful to the classical performance tradition.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues in Kouvola and Oulu Theatres.
According to the co-operation agreement published in the IAA Commercial Vehicles 2018 exhibit in Hanover, Hyundai will provide a 1,000 of these new lorries to be used by Swiss company and its partners.
The police seized the attacker.
Also another assault took place on Välikatu in the centre of Kajaani on Saturday after midnight.
A victim was assaulted by two men.
First a Kajaani man in his twenties hit the victim.
A while later another man knocked him down, and the man who earlier hit him further kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the attackers away from the victim and the police was called.
The police asks the eyewitnesses to contact Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by email at tutkinta.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-time journalist died of cancer aged 83.
The security of ladies and men in shops must be guaranteed
The first time I was paid for a newspaper story was in 1984.
For that story, I also talked with Erika Kähärä, Service Union United (PAM) specialist in working environments.
The police are informed only about those cases that are clearly serious, and many real violent situations are left unreported.
Despite this, psychological traumas can be much more severe than bruises and cuts.
‘Back then quite a few employers organised security guards for at least the night-time hours and to prevent working alone’, Kähärä commented.
Petty assault is an actionable offence, and it is quite understandable that an assaulted salesperson does not want to make a request for investigation about an offender who usually lives close to the shop.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time a shop lady or man is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor prosecute.
After a court would put a few assailants to prison, and if the judgement is from the tougher end of the penal scale, the manners would smarten up.
The show will be hosted by ex Miss Finland, Heidi Sohlberg, and the host of Viasat's and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
The host for backstage and red carpet is Janni Hussi.
In the beginning, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula resounding applauds.
Sieppi discussed her divorce the first time in Ilta-Sanomat weeked newspaper.
She said she’s in no hurry to find a new relationship, but that she is going to focus on herself.
Harjula's marital status emerged also later, when Sohlberg accidentally called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host trio shared a laugh at the blunder.
Janni Hussi acknowledged the mistake.
An Ostrobothnian man tortured his domestic partner by slashing, burning and feeding a strong sauce to her
Pohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia) District Court has sentenced the 34-year-old Kokkola resident to three years of imprisonment for the numerous crimes against his domestic partner.
The most severe charge concerned a suspected aggravated rape.
This charge was however dismissed by the district court.
On Thursday of the past week, Pohjanmaa District Court passed its judgement and ruled that the 34-year-old must continue to be kept in Vaasa prison.
The 34-year-old was also accused of two aggravated deprivations of liberty and of an aggravated rape on the 22nd of May.
The court however dropped these charges as unsubstantiated.
The case was tried behind closed doors.
The district court judge gave a public report on the sentence, though.
According to the district court, the parties continued living together between the deeds.
The imprisonment is not the man's first.
Iltalehti will not publish the name of the convict in order to protect the victim’r privacy.

‘On behalf of our supporters, we apologise the events that took place after the Honka-HJK match’, the press release states.
He is one member of the growing group who swear to have invented a flying car - or at least their own version of it.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass manufacturing of his vehicle.
According to reports from from the world, he has used a great deal of his fortune to build his dream.
Six years ago he began developing his flying car.
Now he calls his development version a dron car.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jam.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action beginning tomorrow will be visible in children’s daycare and in social and health services
Everyone has to think about how to collect their children.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was visible also in the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift-trading because of agreement negotiations.
This is not yet an industrial action.
At this stage, the industrial action applies to nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL actions can potentially last for a long time.
In Jalonen’s opinion, both the trade union movement and the government must meet the other halfway.
Great Barrier Reef by Other Spaces collective had its premiere last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday was its second performance in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Still, Great Barrier Reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance formed in co-operation between the adults and the children.
Great Barrier Reef begins with learning about corals and about movements of organisms and fish who live within the reef.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration for endangered corals is organised at Sitratori.
When she came to get her drunken sister, she told about her sex experiences from that evening.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram, wearing make-up and revealing clothes in their pictures.
Snapchat is used during evening to take and send revealing pictures.
I got to be a child for many, many years, and I didn’t have to wonder what others think about me.
In an interview with Yle, Ilkka Kanerva said Finnish Security Intelligence Service and Finnish Defence Forces came to inform the Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helmi investigation currently has nothing to do with national security, but organised crime, Yle reports.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Security Police visited the Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees to tell about the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered as financial crime.
They were rather strict about not speculating about anything else, Kanerva commented in the Yle interview.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti put together an article scrutinising the allegations both pro and con.
Liverpool winning streak in the Premier League came to an end, but it was still the happier team after a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
The Reds had started the League with six consecutive wins.
As for Chelsea, on Wednesday they won a fine Football League Cup away win on Anfield Road.
Obviously now Hazard was playing from the very first minutes.
On the 25th minute he first played a tight triangle with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally the Croatian saw Hazard rushing forward and sent him a perfectly balanced through ball.
Hazard strayed a bit to the edge of the penalty box, but from there managed to sweep a perfect left-footed volley in to the lower corner.
Klopp must have felt the losing position being slightly unfair, since almost right after Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's shot from the goal line.
The guests’ best chance came on the 72nd minute, as James Milner's crossing found Bobby Firmino.
However, the star Brazilian's header was directed towards his national team mate David Luiz, which saved the home team's lead.
Even that didn't hold anymore on the 89th minute, when substitute Daniel Sturridge had a free shot from 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing on his old home stadium, and to honour that, the forward threw a powerful shot in the upper corner.
Liverpool's winning start of the League came to an end with the 1-1 draw, but it still holds the top position - together with Manchester City.
I remember some decades ago a newspaper asking several Finnish influential persons what divides Finnish people.
Some surnames have a ‘nen’ ending, some do not.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution, even though it has not been that easy.
The people can also have their say on otakantaa.fi site.
The online survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it will be open until Friday 12 October.
Both sides have solid supporters and good arguments.
Since almost everyone has an opinion about this matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to change someone’s mind.
Josba fought a narrow away win
Josba returned home from Seinäjoki with a triumphant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
In 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted the 6-5 winning goal.
The most effective Josba player was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain had a good firepower anyway, as Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) all scored.
The next opponent is O2-Jyväskylä in an away match in two weeks.
Kiihtelysvaara church arson a week ago was a shock.
Despite the pain, today is a day of celebration.
Even if noone would want it to be so, Eno church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu parish union.
The church on a hill in the centre of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all sorts of municipal and other mergers.
It is possible for example to visit the church building guided by retired sacristan of 37 years, Ari Räsänen.
Church birth celebration also is an end of an era.
The church hall, built in 1982 and already taken out of use, will keep its doors open for the last time today.
Elon Musk steps down as chairman of the board for Tesla - Fraud charges settled with $40 million
However, Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla CEO.
Instead, Musk has to step down for three years as chairman of the board for Tesla.
According to the settlement, Tesla will have to appoint two independent directors and oversee Musk’s communications in the future.
‘The resolution is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla’s shareholders’, says SEC co-director Steven Peikin.
In practice, SEC charged Musk with misleading the investors.
On Friday, SEC announced it is going to sue the company and Musk.
Over 800 people died in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The death toll from Indonesia's quake and tsunami disaster has soared to at least 832, the disaster agency said according to news agency AFP.
An earthquake on Friday triggered a tsunami that surged over the Palu city in the island of Sulawesi.
A warning about a tsunami was issued right after the quake, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to officials, nearly all the known deaths are at least so far from Palu.
Cries of help from the ruins
The Indonesian army has been called to aid the rescue workers in searching for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the destruction area today, asked the troops to be ready to work day and night.
One of the focus points of the rescue work is a Palu hotel, the ruins of which are suspected to still hold 50 to 60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the national Search and Rescue Agency managing the rescue work, said that one people has been pulled out alive from the ruins of Roa-Roa hotel, popular with business travellers.
Syaugi said heavy lifting equipment is now quickly needed in the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media in order to find their missing family and friends.
Help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one of the writers pleaded in a Facebook group.
Politicians’ phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in Britain

A Conservative party spokesperson apologised for the breach.
The Wall Finland quiz show's audience has a huge number of applauding Poles every week
The sharp-eyed viewers paid attention to the studio audience reactions in The Wall Finland quiz show.
Hosted by Heikki Paasonen, the game show has been filmed in Poland in the same studio, where the other international productions of the format are made.
There was a Twitter discussion about whether the possible Poles sitting in the studio understand anything about the game played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, managing director of Finnish programmes at Nelonen, explains the issue to Iltalehti.
She says the studio audience consists of the players’ close friends, other Finns, expatriate Finns living in Poland, and Polish viewers.
The Finnish production audience consists of international applauders, just like the audiences of other countries’ The Wall episodes, filmed in the same production space.
He had a continuous simultaneous interpretation coming to his earbud the whole time, and he knew everything that was said in Finnish, Sormunen summarises.

The storm is ecpected to hit near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
Trains have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to meteorologist, Trami will continue to torment Japan until Monday.

Bring the space to life, create an appropriate atmosphere to the decor, and read a book without tiring your eyes.
It is worthwhile to invest in good lighting.
We collected three good reasons to investi in lighting.
The tips came from Innolux Director of Sales and Marketing Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favour to your eyes
As one gets older, also the need for light grows.
A good lamp gives enough light but doesn't cause glares, Jokiniemi gives tips.
Create beauty around you
Modern home decorator has plenty to choose from.
On the other hand, also the modern and playful retro style drawing inspiration from the 70s has had a boom in popularity, with its different metallic tones and icecream colours.
Express your personality
Instead of mass production, people want to have a tailored, even a bold lamp that has a story to tell.
They are very design-aware, Jokiniemi says.
Thanks and goodbye!

According to Puurula, recycling causes no additional trouble.
Classic clothes work from season to season, in any outfit.
With their versatility they create a good basis for a wardrobe, because it is easy to assemble different outfits around quality classics even inexpensively.
In the autumn, the most used wardrobe classics include high-quality knits.
Black sweater with a turtleneck, made from natural materials can’t be a wrong purchase.
This is how to create the style.
Youthful and stylish!
During Soviet times, so called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in the Crimea in February 2014; they dressed in local Ukrainian riot police's gear, set up checkpoints on the roads leading from peninsula to Ukraine, and sealed Crimea off from its mother country.

HPK will keep Riska for the rest of the season, Lehtinen’s trial period over
Even if there is still room for improvement, it is good for a young team to hold on to such an experienced player, stated HPK sport manager Mika Toivola in the team's press release.
According to Toivola, Riska’s value will rise when playing deciding games in the icehockey League.
Originally from Pietarsaari, forward centre Riska has played league hockey previously in JYP, Lukko, and Sport.
Tonight’s movie is based on them.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 direction tells about the fight for survival that has been covered plenty of times.
22 years ago, the world's highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
It was precisely Hall, who was Weathers’ guide.
Because of that and the air pressure, he lost his eye sight, which meant he had to pass the climb to the summit.
Rob Hall continued to climb and didn’t return.
However, Weathers’ life-and-death struggle had only just begun.
As the storm blew up, he got lost and didn’t find his way back to the camp.
Weathers was left to die.
At some point, also his fellow climbers began to believe in his chances to such an extent they helped him.
The film features Josh Brolin as Beck Weathers,
Eno church bicentenary has been celebrated today
517 people took part in the family service.
Eno vicar Armi Rautavuori was happy that people showed up in the church in such great numbers.
It will be a great joy for a long time yet and gives energy for my work, Rautavuori (in the picture) says.
The Kiihtelysvaara church fire has resonated with many, and it was not ignored in the Eno church bicentenary celebration.

Kiihtelysvaara wooden church was completed in 1770.
A prayer meeting was organised at Kiihtelysvaara in the morning, where the people calmed down and reminisced the church that was destroyed in a fire.
A strong, hurricane-type autumn storm rolled to Greece from the southwest on Saturday.
A Mediterranean hurricane, a medicane, has been named Zorba.
Another video shows a car being carried by floodwaters.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructed people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited possibilities of finding proper protection.
No going offshore, the flights still on schedule - there are currently thousands of Finns holidaying in the Greek islands threatened by an autumn gale.
During the weekend, the guides distributed these kinds of instructions for the about 3,500 Finns holidaying in Greek via Aurinkomatkat.
The rottenness of the weather is made worse by torrential rains.
According to Aurinkomatkat Deputy Communications Manager Inka Ikonen, by Saturday early evening, the holiday resorts have managed to avoid the worst.
A media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at Miss Finland final on Saturday wearing a low-backed evening dress.
Hussi says she got the dress from Meslew.
The pair themselves noticed their matching outfits and reacted with laughter.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat her preparations were hurried, and she had to get ready in an aeroplane.
Hussi has a recent move behind her, since she moved to Jätkäsaari from Kamppi on Friday.
For the time being I’m going to stay there, we’ll see what happens.
Before the move, Hussi holidayed alone in Greece.
I changed into my evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says she drew out her makeup kit surrounded by pensioners.
Her preparations drew the fellow travelers’ attention.
My makeup was amusing at least to others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
Karvinen says she has enjoyed her work as host for Love Island Finland.
Karvinen says she said hello to the show's singles on Friday.
How to wear over-the-knee boots?
Classic clothes are garments that work from season to season, in any outfit.
As the name describes, boots coming up to above the knees repeat stylishly year after year, season after season.
You see, over-the-knee boots suit almost any kind of outfit.
No matter whether it's denim, lace, tulle or tricot, the boots’ simple leather or fake leather surface works.
Long boots look good both with party looks and with everyday outfits.
Black over-the-knee boots match even very soft outfits.
A fresh but stylishly autumnal everyday outfit to suit a romantic taste.
Even though over-the-knee boots have a certain elegance, they are also a perfect match to a relaxed everyday outfit, together with a t-shirt, long shorts, and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
If it is not, they decipher whether the sensed obstruction is a vehicle, a bicycle, or for example a snow flake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, the company in charge of developing robot traffic.
The surest way to get aboard is from the stop number 1 at Otakaari.

Mykkänen travels to Turkey to observe the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (National Coalition) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to observe the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
The United Nations’ High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR first selects people who are in an especially vulnerable situation as candidates.
There are more people selected to the group arriving in Finland than the quota requires, since in practice some of them will not arrive for different reasons.
While in Turkey, Minister Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Minister of the Interior, Süleyman Soylu, and non-governmental organisations operating on the Syrian border.
Finland has been admitting quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 refugees per year, but since then, the Government has not reached an agreement about an increase.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) recently proposed the quota to be increased gradually to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen’s visit is the first one the Minister of the Interior makes to observe the selection of quota refugees during this term of government.
The former Ministers of the Interior, Petteri Orpo (National Coalition) and Paula Risikko (National Coalition), transferred to their new tasks before the visits could be arranged.
Last Saturday Karjalainen reported on the legislative proposal to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
I don't doubt that the Animal Welfare Act needs an update.
It looks remarkably good especially in skirts.
Pair a snakeskin skirt with a subdued top, like a turtleneck or a regular t-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.

Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulks in a charming manner in Jere’s arms
In Karalahti family photo all the attention is on the sweet baby Alexia, aged three months.
Nanna Karalahti tells about Aito day care centre founded in Kerava.
Sport industry entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, had a baby in the beginning of July.
The couple's firstborn Jax had his second birthday in May, and the little Alexia is only three months old.
Recently Nanna Karalahti organised a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, and the whole Karalahti family went along.
The attention is drawn to cute, sulking baby Alexia, who is resting in father Jere's arms.
Thankful for this.
Thankful for goodness, for forgiving, for people’s generosity and joy, Nanna Karalahti wrote to accompany the family portrait.
In addition to two Karalahtis, also Johannes Laine, diet expert, and Hanna Liisanantti, responsible for educational matters, are involved in the company.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the day care centre manager.
Turkey recommends people to charge their cell phones in case of a storm
The Zorba storm that blew in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Red weather warning in Greece
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned the Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
Also the Finnish Embassy in Athens issued a storm warning.
Aaltonen described the situation to be similar still on Saturday evening.
By the evening the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had received no messages from Finns in distress.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions were expected in air and ship traffic.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes supremacy compared to Ferrari
There’s no reason for panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimated.
Räikkönen was asked what is the cause for the sudden drop behind Mercedes.
They seem to go faster than us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we’d probably go as fast as they are going.
However, I don't know anymore than anyone else.
Charles Leclerc, who replaces Räikkönen at Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also managed to make it to the final qualifying session.
And even if there were as many as five drivers not participating in the second session, the end result was still delicious for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen, considering the next season.
Next year there will be a different story, so we’ll see, we’ll see.
That was it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: ‘Robbe is back’
The German had more initiative in the ring, but he didn’t manage to land good hits.
Helenius has a significantly wider reach and controlled the match with his hard series of punches that found their way in well.
The resolve finally came in the eighth round, as Helenius knocked Teper out with his left cross.
The punch was so hard the veteran, who was fighting in front of a home crowd, didn’t even try to get up from the mat.
After victory was confirmed, Helenius’ celebration was quite calm.
In the ring interview he first complimented the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Thank you for all the spectators and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
A defeat, on the other hand, might've ended his whole boxing career.
Of course I've thought about it.
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country warns about a clear rise in the number of victims.
Difficult circumstances
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
For example, hotel Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Indonesian president Joko Widodo has ordered the troops to help in rescue and clearing work.
New Miss Finland is currently being chosen at Billnäs Ruukki.
The finalists drew a question from a glass bowl on a table.
Question that was posed to Anttikoski came through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the last book the finalist has read.
Anttikoski considered her answer for quite a while, before she hesitantly began:
Thank you for your question, Pirkko-Ella.
Her pause for consideration caused roars of laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued:
I've read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I’ve read is something about economics, Anttikoski answered.
After her answer, Anttikoski received resounding applauds from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier during the Miss Finland tour Anttikoski attracted attention because she didn’t want to pose in just underwear on account of her principles.

Max Seeck represents Finnish authors in the festival.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
They craved for experiences and cared little for outsiders’ evaluations.
They managed their relationships worse than their once more unnoticeable peers.
Luxury cars, designer bags or watches signifying high status do not make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
The storm will be very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens reports about it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Hellenic National Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to these areas.
According to it, the strongest winds can be up to 45 metres per second.
By way of comparison, the Kuisma storm that lashed Finland early in the week blew about 31 metres per second at its height.
According to the blog, the biggest concern of Zorba storm is not the wind though, but the heavy rain.
This is equivalent of about a half of Finnish annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the storm development on its Facebook page.
