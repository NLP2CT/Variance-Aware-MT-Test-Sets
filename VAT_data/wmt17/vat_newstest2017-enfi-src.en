28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
He was the brother that went with the flow.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.

Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
No-one knows yet.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.

Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Brilliant all over.
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
A witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.

And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.

Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.

Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report

A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
The price of the food in Finland drops clearly faster than the EU average
During the last three years, the price of food in Finland has dropped the second most in those EU countries that have the same wage level than Finland.
The situation was alarming.
That is why the supply of dairy and meat products has increased in the Finnish market, and the producer prices have dropped.
For the consumer the price competition has appeared as impressive advertising campaigns.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.
Those returning to school may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new teaching curriculum has been created for schools, and it will be implemented in the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the curriculum states the official goals.
These guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old ones in many ways.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of the pupils.
Before it was thought that a teacher teaches the pupils, but now everyone has to be active and learn from one another.
This is an attempt to make education more interesting.
The longest lived vertebrate in the world was found - the Greenland shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), also known as the grey shark, does not reach its sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
It can live 250 years after that, a new study reported.
Greenland sharks swim around the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are also the biggest fish in the arctic area.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about a centimetre a year according to monitoring, the adult specimens must have lived a long life.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen together with his colleagues found out.
The average age of the studied sharks was revealed to be at least 272 years.
Since the other studies have found out that the Greenland shark females do not reach maturity until they are over 4 metres long, the researchers calculated they are about 150 years old at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
“As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be cut, main part of the cuts will be carried out as lay-offs”, Stockmann says in its press release.
Already earlier Stockmann has begun an efficiency programme, with which they attempt to create savings of 50 million euros this year.
Even though the group’s adjusted operating result improved to 11.1 million euros in the second quarter of the year, the department store sales are still unprofitable.
“Personnel reductions are unfortunately a necessary step to ensure that Stockmann’s retail division achieves a positive result in 2018”, Veijalainen says in the press release.
Lindex’s profit increased 9.5 million euros to 28.1 million euros.
At the same time last year, the operating result of the whole Stockmann Group had a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover this year will be smaller than last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
The temperatures are not very summery anymore, because the mercury will stay below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The rainy areas in the north will remain in 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletics team is shaken by a doping scandal - an odd explanation to a coach’s move
A Kenyan athletics coach, John Anzrah, has been sent home from Rio Olympics after he was found to have been posing as a national team athlete in doping tests.
Stephen Arap Soi, who is part of Kenya’s national team management, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he “committed his crime against team Kenya”.
“He presented himself as an athlete, gave the urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour," growled Kip Keino, chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya to the news agency Reuters.
The Olympic athletics begins on Friday, and Rotich is to run already on that day.
According to Reuters, a source from inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah only used the athlete’s accreditation card to get free breakfasts in the athlete’s village.
When he met the anti-doping officials, they expected him to be an athlete, and he was taken to a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials, because he was afraid of being exposed.
Where is everyone?
Indeed, where is everyone?
They are certainly not at the Rio Olympic stadium watching athletics.
The organisers of Rio told on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first day's morning competition tickets and 65 per cent of the evening competition tickets have been sold.
The situation was different four years ago in London, where the stadium was bursting with cheering people.
The spectator loss at Rio Olympics has attracted attention already before athletics.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30 per cent of the stands that seat 12.000 people were full.
The bad sales are partly explained by the fact that Brazil with its economic difficulties is far away for the European and Asian Olympic tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians, who are accustomed to football.
However, not even the first match of the Brazilian football team managed to fill the football stadium.
The spokesman for the game organisers, Mario Andrada, said this weekend that at that time, 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold, a number that is clearly smaller than four years ago.
“There are still 1.1 million tickets left to be sold”, Andrada said according to Reuters.
From the 8.5 million tickets in the London Olympics 8.2 million were sold, even though they were almost half more expensive than in Rio.
In Rio, the ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros for the opening.
Over half of the tickets cost under 16 euros.
In London Olympics, the voluntary workers and army personnel were allowed to sit on the empty seats, but in Rio this has not been allowed yet, as the organisers need money and attempt to sell the tickets until the very last moment.
However, in Rio, the organisers have given school children 240.000 tickets for those sports that are less known in the country, like gold and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats in the Rio Stadium in the morning.

A new way to protect the nature - buy a right to a piece of land
The Foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically significant areas of land.
After that, private people, companies, and communities can purchase Guardianship rights to a block of land.
The Helsinki Foundation is a non-profit foundation established for the purpose of promoting the conservation of environment and nature.
The risk is for the Foundation to act in unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The Foundation acquires land blocks either by buying or as a donation.
It finances its operation mainly by selling Guardianships, but the Foundation received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also has plans to go outside Finnish borders and to buy some land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation showcases its operations in a pop up forest at Helsinki Market Square from August 13 to 19.
Based on the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat describes how many bicycles and their parts have been stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August this year per capita.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were at the top of the list.
Instead in Espoo and Kouvola, there were only about two reported bicycle thefts per a thousand residents.
That is a big difference.
It is extremely difficult to say, why there have been more bicycle thefts in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer for that.
“For example Espoo is a completely different city, where city centres are far from each other, and bicycle is not necessarily the primary mode of transport”, Reen says.
In the whole of Finland between January and August, there have been slightly less bike thefts reported to the police than during the corresponding period last year.
That means 50-60 bikes every day, and just in Helsinki, about 4000 bikes per year.
“These numbers are big”, Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week either red-handed or during a police investigation, says Senior Constable Timo Leppämäki.
As to the individual bike models, the most stolen is Jopo, just like in previous years.
A U-lock gives a bicycle better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take a bicycle for example for their own, brief use, but most of the stolen bicycles end up for sale for example online.
“At least it hasn’t come to the police's knowledge that stolen bicycles hardly go abroad”, Reen says.
Buyers of stolen bikes are normal Finnish people, according to the police.
Some probably buy a stolen bike without knowing.
“The alarm bells should be ringing, if a bicycle in good condition is being sold dirt cheap”, Reen says.
Special library assistant Severi Hirvi always carries his colourful Nopsa to a shelter provided by library of Kallio in Helsinki for the duration of his working day.
“Maybe this isn’t so tempting for the thieves, this doesn’t necessarily even have any hipster value”, contemplates Hirvi, who lives in Helsinki.
“Mostly bad bikes, these rickety Jopos.”
Those under 15 to account for their crimes?
Helsinki will experiment peer juries familiar from the United States
At first the experiment will be applied to those under 15, who now are left without criminal responsibility.
Other consequences could be for example a letter written to the family explaining, what has been done and what has been learnt from it.
Youth work director Tommi Laitio says it is not a strict model.
We also have other conciliation models that are used side by side.
Before the first crimes of especially those under 15 years of age have not necessarily been dealt with at all.
“It has been a message to carry on on the path you have chosen”, Lovio says.
Lovio emphasises that these new practises are offered to all who need them, not just for young immigrants.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to sign a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
According to the newspaper, the letter is directed to the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
According to the letter, this should not be a difficult decision, as Trump’s chances of being elected president are evaporating by the day.
Politico writes that the letter is expected to be sent next week.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter is coming from “people who want the party to protect its majorities in the Senate and the House”, and that it’s not an endorsement of anybody.
He is said to also have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week 50 officials working among national security wrote an open letter to state that they won’t support Donald Trump as a president.
Clinton promises relief to U.S. families with children
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shared details of his economic policy on Thursday evening.
“Donald Trump aims to be the President, so that the economy would be good for him and his friends”, Clinton said in her speech.
In the centre of Clinton’s plan is a massive five-year, 275-billion dollar plan to improve United States’ infrastructure, roads, bridges, and airfields.
This would be financed partly with tax increases for the rich, partly with private money.
Clinton called this programme the greatest investment in well-paid jobs since the Second World War.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, she sounded like Sanders anyway as she emphasised that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax exile, it should pay a leaving tax, Clinton said.
“[As the President,] I will oppose all those trade agreements that work against employees or wages”, Clinton promised.
On Thursday, Clinton emphasised that she herself is a daughter of a small entrepreneur.
She reminded the listeners about small entrepreneurs, whose invoices Trump has left unpaid, and about clothes, Trump himself fabricates in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by manufacturing products in America himself”, Clinton mocked.
So far, the most interesting Olympic sports have been cycling on Sunday evening and artistic gymnastics that opened the fifth game day. Both of these reached almost half a million viewers at a time on the Olympic channel.
The head of Yle Sport, Panu Pokkinen, is satisfied with the ratings and notes that for the first time ever, the viewers are divided between several different devices.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are satisfied with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics in the first place.
Even on the television side, the viewers are divided between TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
Rio Olympics is the first sporting event Yle has dedicated a whole channel to.
The viewer ratings are lower than in London 2012 or Beijing 2008, but one reason for this is the time difference - most of the Rio games are broadcast in Finland during the night time.
In addition, the athletics is only just beginning, as well as other sports that interest Finns: sailing and riding.
When the athletics begin, the ratings explode.
Yle launched a Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the games, and during the first game days it became Apple App Store's most downloaded free application in Finland.
By Monday, the application had been downloaded 150,000 times.
Rio Areena has not worked as desired with all the users.
There are now updated versions of the applications that should fix these bugs.
Rio Olympics have a wider coverage on Yle’s channels and in Areena than any other sporting event ever before.
From the year 2018 onwards Olympic sports can be seen both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, it's depth being 95,3 metres at Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
In summer 2014, Finnish Environment Institute attempted to confirm the finding using echo-sounding, but it was in vain.
The method does not necessarily find a small hollow from a hundred metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So for now the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
They have not been studied as much as Päijänne.
Especially Inarijärvi’s bottom has not been carefully mapped.
“There might well be some unknown depths”, Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by its average depth, it would be Suuri Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
Pensioners’ taxation is still tighter than the wage-earners’.
There is nothing like this in the Government’s proposal.
We think it should definitely be there.
The issue heated up the members of the opposition, who grilled the then Minister of Finance, Alexander Stubb (Coalition), about the election promises.
Purchasing power secured, will not grow
He says the tax deduction has a positive impact on purchase power and employment, if there are no other things that add to people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (Centre) and Orpo’s messages about the will to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact .
It is the most important action in both economic and employment policies.
It is necessary, because the economy relies so much on the domestic demand and on people's own optimism about the future.
In June, there were 17,000 more long-term unemployed people than a year before.
He says that if this growth will not stop, the Government’s goal of increasing the employment rate to 72 per cent will be lost.
He warns that if the challenge posed by prolonged unemployment is overlooked, it will mean a very large societal bill.
According to Westphalen, currently there are very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact numbers are difficult to estimate.
The Embassy has attempted to contact especially those Finns that are in Hua Hin, in order to get information about the town’s situation.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Generally speaking everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
The ambassador thinks the incidents may be connected to the political unrest in Thailand’s disunited society, and to the referendum last week about the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law passed in the referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country people got for example arrested, when they had declared that they oppose the law.
As for the Southern provinces in Thailand, there smoulders an ethnic-racial conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to increase their autonomy.
There was a big, local festival day in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
According to her, the city is celebrating the Queen's birthday and Mothers’ Day.
According to the police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and differ from customary terrorist attacks.
Also Islamic terrorism has been ruled out, Thailand police report according to the news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand during 24 hours, as 11 bombs have exploded around the country, like for example in tourist favourites Phuket and Hua Hin.
According to current information, they did not claim any lives.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the paper.
Both double bombings killed at least one.
Furthermore, at least one bomb exploded in both the village of Surat Thani and the city of Trang in South-Thailand.
Also Surat Thani is familiar to many a traveller, since the way to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, and Ko Tao holiday islands goes through it.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, head of the military junta ruling Thailand, the quarter responsible for the attacks is so far not known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not stir up any more panic in the people, he said to the journalists.
According to Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister in charge of security, at least the Hua Hin and Trang attacks are linked.
Those Finns that are planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their journey because of the explosions, but they should follow the Embassy’s advice about caution, says Westphalen.
Europeans among the wounded
There are at least German, Italian, Dutch, and Austrian people among the wounded.
Thai PBS reports that the police have roped of the Hua Hin area they believe to have found yet another bomb.
One municipality employee died in the attack.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
Alexandra Raisman from the U.S. was the second with a score of 60.098, and Russia’s Alija Mustafina was the third with her score of 58.665 points.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics at will during the last years.
She has 8 personal world championships from three previous seasons.
If there are no more attacks, I believe nothing much will follow from this, estimates Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia about two decades.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies in Thailand close up.
There is always something here.
First a tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Huovila’s company offices are located a few hundred metres from the bomb attack scene.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called him about nine o’clock local time and said he should not come to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and the main street, Bangla Road, were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace as usual in the morning.
They thought the road blocks were set up because of the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At the beach, many of the people hadn’t even heard about the attacks.
Around 2.30 in the afternoon Thailand’s time, the traffic at Patong had returned to normal, and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Later the car in question was spotted in Jouxholmintie, Kruunupyy.
When the police reached the place, the car was set on fire.
One of the men was immediately caught.
The other made a run for it, but was later found from the forest with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected to be guilty of stealing of a motor vehicle for temporary use, theft, and gross damage.
Ivanov’s successor is a 44-year old Anton Vaino of Estonian background.
He is an ex-diplomat and has been Ivanov’s deputy.
Kangaspuro says that a reason behind Ivanov’s dismissal can be Putin’s will to prevent strong people around him of gathering too much power.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or that he has blundered.
Putin said that Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another role, and had proposed Vaino as a candidate for his position, reported Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in status.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people on the top or Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has had a significant role in the president’s Security Council.
During Soviet times, Ivanov worked at KGB together with Putin.
He was considered as Putin’s possible successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became the president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example the governors, has been recently replaced in Russia.
Senior Research Fellow Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that the fact that Putin is replacing his inner circle with younger people is more interesting than who is Ivanov's successor.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields while retreating in Syria
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars, where they were taken to Jarabulus.

Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s definition of document access policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior’s definition of document access policy is unlawful, says professor of public law, Tomi Voutilainen, from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that document access cannot be based on an official’s own policies, but it is based on law.
Earlier the Ministry of the Interior refused to surrender the participant list of the Minister of Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified his decision with the instructions by the Prime Minister’s Office and with the fact that the information was entered in the Minister’s calendar, not in the accounting material.
The Chief Communications Officer of the Ministry says to STT that the need of reforming the practices has been remarked in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt’s final Olympic show begins in Rio
Early in the season, he hurt his back thigh, and had to pass Olympic qualifications in Jamaica.
I've been training well, and that’s the key thing, Bolt said in his press conference in Rio.
The murmuring around Bolt underlines that fact that the star of the Jamaican has risen during the age when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt previous defeat in Olympic games was in Athens 2004, when he was eliminated in 200 metres preliminaries with a time of 21,05.
Four years later in Beijing, he started his reign on the hundred metres, when he crushed the world record and the competitors’ self-confidence with a time of 9,69, reached despite the final celebrations.
This is harder
Last year in Beijing WC finals Bolt won the American by only one hundredth of a second.
During his reign that began in Beijing, Bolt has not lost once in an elite competition finals, if only he has managed to start.
He is an old man in young men’s sport, and Rio games are his final Olympics.
Bolt has set the final finish line for his career to be next year's WC games in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the pack.
I’m older now, and it’s harder for me.
But anytime I start feeling really down, I remind myself, you have got to get this done this year, Bolt said three months ago in a Sports Illustrated interview.
Disclosures from Rio: two athletes suspected of a doping offence
According to China’s national news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has tested positive to banned drugs at the Rio Olympics.
Also Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, Kenyan athletics coach was sent home for giving a doping sample for an athlete.
She was fourth in Rio in women’s 100 m breaststroke.
The International Olympic Committee IOC said on Thursday a Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete during a test and given a doping sample for him.
According to media information, the man in question is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
Daily Mail says he had used the game pass of 800 m runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, American Michael Phelps won his 22. Olympic gold in 200 m medley in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won already 22 Olympic golds.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to win Olympic gold from the same individual event in four consecutive Games.
Phelps’ winning time was 1.54,66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was second in the medley before China’s Wang Shun.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Television is a visual media, she emphasises.
Surely Skelton want to cut a dash and possible startle, too, but she stresses that she doesn’t want to be in the main role.
This is not about me, she states.
We’re here to watch sports, and the focus should be on the athletes.
No, I cannot, but anything that draws the focus on how hard these swimmers are working and on the big sacrifices they’re doing is fine by me, grins Skelton.
You know what?
I’m a little amused, if this has hit someone’s radar.
Police in Rio made to arrests because of a terrorism suspicion
The police in Rio announced on Thursday it has arrested two persons suspected of terrorism.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before releasing them.
All the suspected have been Brazilians.
According to news website G1, the persons arrested for terrorism are part of the same group, whose members were arrested by the police already in July.
The arrested people are suspected of having contact with extremist organisation Isis.
As far as is known, the arrested had incited violence in the social media.
The messages encouraging violence had been distributed for example in the popular WhatsApp service.
There are 85,000 police officers answering for the security at Rio Games.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to begin their Rio's basketball tournament early division match in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package from the basketball arena and closed the place from audience.
This was the third time during Rio Olympics that the police performed a controlled detonation task.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package there.
The audience did not make it to the stands by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while because of a suspicious package found from the hall.
The police detonated the package and let the audience in only after that.

Unfortunately, just having sex as it is, is not enough.
The same study connected these things to an overall lower risk of mortality.
Many studies have attempted to find a reason for the phenomenon.
One explanation could be that an ambitious person most likely lives in a way that brings extra years to their life.
This is because going to a concrete shop reduces loneliness.
The accident took place at Koski, halfway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie, on Friday at 9 pm.

Posti postal service sent bulk sweets to a wrong town
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was at Salo’s K-Citymarket on Thursday buying bulk sweets, when she saw a funny sign.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing, and decided to share it on the social media.
The background for this is that three of five pallets lost their way and ended up in a wrong place (Seinäjoki), and we didn’t do a partial delivery (to Salo) at three o’clock, but delivered the five pallets only today, Kaidesoja said to Ilta-Sanomat.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos following a change of lifestyle.

At Flow, megalomania is a virtue
The precise criteria of enjoyment and ambitious visions have established the status of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starred by the top artists in the world.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
The festival guests have typically expressed themselves with individual dressing.
One of the main stage artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with for example artificial turf and art installations.
For us, it has never been enough just to have a main stage and a beer tent, says the Artistic Director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
Flow Festival, organised in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event with tens of thousands visitors.
Behind the success, there is a simple question: What kind of an event would the organisers themselves want to attend?
A week before the event he knew, that Flow will sell out also this year.
The goal has been to increase the last year’s number of visitors, 70.000, by 5.000 people.
There will be a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists at the festival also this year.
On the other hand, we don't want to grow too much, because at some point the masses would be like cattle that is herded in huge channels.
During 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been magnified in a way that the area, partly decorated with artificial turf, hosts 130 performers, art installations, and a number of restaurant points and cocktail bars.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented also in a simpler way.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that nowadays even big visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, mid 00s, the operation was very dependent on the support of about 20.000 euros from the city of Helsinki.
Last year the turnover of the limited company that manages Flow was about six million euros.
In addition to a music event, one can also call this a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not purposely profiled itself as especially fashionable.
Still, also fads fit in to Flow’s set of values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is a legend of punk, 69 years old Iggy Pop.
According to Kallio Iggy was booked, since this is most likely the last time the artist is gigging in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and future.
Not just what is played in commercial radio.
Iggy’s latest album was bloody good, and he has performed bloody well on his gigs in recent years.
On Thursday evening local time, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died and over 20 were wounded in the attack.
The bombs were located on a street where most of the customers are foreign.
They went off at the same time as the tourists began to leave the bars to go back to their hotels, said a police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran according to CNN.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
In the next morning local time two bombs went off in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of the wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs went off on the island of Phuket that is popular also among Finns.
As far as is known, nobody died.
At the same time there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
According to the Thai authorities, those responsible for the bomb attacks are most likely rebel groups that are not satisfied with the actions of Thailand’s military leadership.
According to Aftonbladet, the police has lately been snapping at the criminal organisations dealing in human trafficking.
In an acute war situation, the conscripts won’t be sent to battle until several months after they have sworn their oath, says Keskisuomalainen.

Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hard argument about a house they bought from Espoo in 2009.
After the closing of the deal, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing unhealthy microbe growth.
The couple had to sell the house to be demolished in 2014.
The couple filed the matter in court and there claimed a price reduction from the seller.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal passed judgement on the matter on Wednesday.
It retained in force the District Court judgement by which the seller was imposed to pay a price reduction of 150,000 euros to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller has to cover the couple’s legal and settlement costs for a total of 47,000 euros.
However, according to the Court of Appeals, the construction defects that appeared were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
At the Court of Appeal Tola told that the couple had been specifically looking for a home in good condition, since they didn’t want to do repair work.
Based on the discussions it wasn’t however revealed that this would be an urgent matter at all.
Tola and Waroma had the impression that the rain waters from the rock should probably be slightly directed within a couple of years.
Within a few years it appeared that the humidity problems of the house were much more serious than previously thought.
There was also argument in the court about whether the house had been extended against the building permit.
The court held that before closing of the deal, Tola and Waroma were not aware of the Espoo city decision that there had been changes to the house that were against the permit.
For example the patios had been built even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, the mould problems were the crucial matter at court.
In the Court of Appeal’s opinion, Tola and Waroma had no special reason to conduct an unusually extensive inspection.
The buyers have not neglected their duty to investigate, stated the Court of Appeal in its decision.
Journalist Christopher Andersson describes in his recent article in Dagens Nyheter, how there are microfilms in the National Archives in Maryland, U.S., that contain documents concerning a total of 218,000 women, who all wanted to marry an SS man.
Most of the women are German, but there are also American, French, Dutch, and Russian women.
In addition, there were at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish, and 31 Swedish women who wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and register cards that come from the Race Office that operated in Nazi Germany.
None of SS men in Nazi Germany were allowed to have children before they were examined by an SS doctor.
The same was even more true to women, who had to be able to give birth to even more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were given gynaecological examinations to confirm this.
The goal was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women’s family tree.
The Race Office wanted guarantees of the women being “fond of children”, “frugal”, and “good National Socialists”, who could speak German well.
The women who did not fulfil these requirements were not accepted as brides for the SS men.
The SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme for example determined that each SS men should have four children, either in or out of wedlock.
Lebensborn homes took care of the children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
The programme was not very actively promoted, though, it says on the website of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policies were focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marrying by offering loans and supported having children.
The Cross of Honor of the German Mother was given to women, who had borne at least four children.
Marriages between “Aryans” and “non-Aryans” were forbidden by law in Nazi Germany, it is stated on the museum website.
Petäjä-Siren sixth, Nirkko rose and dropped
Nirkko rose to eighth place in the total points after five starts, but the failure in the second start dropped him to place 14.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were left on place 23 in the opening start of the day.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded after a couple of hours sleep: “I was so hung-over”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finns’ favourite artists already for over 20 years.
In the competition Sillanpää sang tangos, but already then he had planned somewhat different music for himself.
And the song ‘Satulinna’ did become one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells that the recording of the song did not quite go according to plans: Sillanpää had a terrible hangover when he sang the song on tape, and he had only slept for a couple of hours.
We’d had a party the previous night.
I was so hung-over!
Sillanpää recalls in the book.
Another incident, narrated in the book and relating to his most popular songs, happened almost two decades later.
In 2013, Sillanpää separated from his then partner, and the incident also ended up in the texts of ‘Sinä ansaitset kultaa’ song that was published as a single in 2014.
Sillanpää had imagined he was doing a record that tells a true story of his own life, but the lyrics of the song about break-up weren’t true, but written based on a piece of news from 7 päivää magazine.
According to book, Jari was furious when he called to the record company and refused to sing the song, but finally decided on singing it - and that’s good.
In June the Brits managed to surprise even themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 per cent of the voters supported the exit and 48 per cent would have stayed in the union, even though the opinion polls from the vote week anticipated an opposite result.
Not one of the respected research institutes or universities carried the exit flag, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to differ from the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of the Western politics, the catchphrase from the election campaign of the ex-US President Bill Clinton, “It's the economy, stupid”, was scrapped in Britain’s Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked, when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked, when it seemed that economy was not the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly speech
In its latest monthly questionnaire, the Centre for Macroeconomics demands answers for Brexit disaster from the professional society.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters based their decision on something other than economic grounds.
One economist explanation for the loss of economy's position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many also have an impression that it would be a good thing if the value of the currency fell, since it promotes the exporting industries.
According to the economist base, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, since the unanimity of the economists did not come up enough.
The press, hostile to EU, were not interested in mentioning what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, LSE, and other powerful economic letter combinations thought of the exit consequences.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, national debt, and currency.
And if the economists’ messages were both listened to and understood, then they were disregarded, because the economists present such elite with which the voters do not think to have anything in common.
The big city academics such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and in countryside the message was ineffective.
The overwhelming winning argument in the Brexit vote concerned immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will jam your hospitals, an immigrant will abuse you.
Every cafe has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the Brits have, if they were to leave?
There are immigrants in every waiting room of every health centre.
Every school has immigrants’ children, too.
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have, if they would vanish?
I feel these are economic questions.
They concern jobs, accommodation, and public services.
The economists did not manage to answer them, however, and even if they did, their answers did not get any visibility.
The economists did not succeed in explaining that thanks to immigrants, the Brits have more jobs, less health centre queues, and more money in education and social security than before.
Immigrants, and above all EU immigrants, are net contributors to the British public economy, and their spending creates jobs.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by a Finn Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by working out A and B plans.
The concern was that the investors would begin to withdraw their funds away from the market.
Usually a real estate fund does not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 per cent of the fund investments either in cash or as liquid assets, says Vanhanen about Aberdeen’s only daily quoted real estate fund the news concerned.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The fund value then was £3.5 bn.
Usually the company’s funds’ value is about £20 bn.
This is the highest amount in nine open-end real estate funds, Vanhanen says about all open-end real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest cash amount in these funds remained at 10 per cent or even lower.
When the camp supporting EU exit won, Europe went mad.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit can be a big risk for commercial real estate actors.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
These together turned the situation upside down, and highlighted the issue in the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to years 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
The institutional investors stayed calmer, but the private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to roll, and a fund after another had to close its doors.
The Aberdeen situation was good because of the collected cash assets, but in the end it, too, had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not exactly close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
The message of Aberdeen was that if you do not have to withdraw your money now, it is not profitable, because it would result in losses.
That calmed the situation, and the most cancelled their notice.
After that, things have been quite even, and for a couple of weeks now, the market has been very calm, says Vanhanen.
He notes that for example Aberdeen's Continental Europe funds have had no such agitation.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
Some other funds are still closed.
This week, Aviva Investors warned its investors that it may keep its funds closed until 2017.
At the moment there is a lot of uncertainty around, and the economy growth predictions have been adjusted downwards, but the situation does not look “wilder” relative to Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now relate to the future development of British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new possibilities to some real estate investors, notes Vanhanen.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same estate for as much as 30 per cent less.
There are a low of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought drawbacks to London property market
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is in charge of British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management’s property investments, woke up to recheck the results of the Brexit vote, the situation had changed.
I realised that we had to soon rely on plan B, Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He headed for work straight away.
It was a morning you’d never expect to live, Vanhanen says.
Not just because, despite the turbulence, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finalised two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote, at Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confused.
The company had been preparing well for this alternative, and in that sense, the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
A storm followed the vote.
The market began to anticipate heavy fall in British real estate market, and especially in London.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade, one after another.
Now the storm has abated, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
So much is still open: how the exit will happen, and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
There have already been some early information about the development of London real estate market.
According to this data, all the real estate prices in London went down 3,3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings the price drop was 6,1 per cent, lists Vanhanen.
The monthly index publishing was began in 1987, and there have been worse numbers only in five months, says Vanhanen.
Vanhanen thinks that this comparison is not quite apposite, because this is a homespun British crisis.
There has been no panic selling like then, but more a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
According to Aberdeen’s estimation, the real estate prices in London and other number one cities in the world have been too high already for years.
For two years now, we have said that the City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has the population in London.
Another big trend is that the real estate is the last class of ownership to be globalised, says Vanhanen.
There are new market actors from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and also private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
As a well-known city, London is an easy target.
And, on top of that, loan has been easily available, even though Vanhanen says that the leverage has been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Even Aberdeen began to lighten their holdings in London, and was indeed a net seller last year.
Some kind of a turn was to be expected, and here it is.
It depends on how British national economy will develop, says Vanhanen.
Vanhanen has already seen several up and down movements, because he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
He believes in global diversification.
If you have diversified, also the risks have been diversified, says Vanhanen.
S Group to start registering shopping information more closely
Here the S Group follows after Kesko, since information about items purchased with a K-Plussa card has been gathered to Kesko’s customer register already for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy Managing Director Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Item-specific information is gathered with the consent of the customer, and it is used to marketing subject to permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have forbidden the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko will not react to S Group’s registering change.
The classification is updated monthly.
The regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchased items and the money used.
The information is used to target marketing to the customer.
Partners, like for example Neste Oil, do not give away their information.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus customer loyalty programme one can join in a Valintatalo, Siwa or Euromarket.
We have not gone to K-Group’s or S Group’s level, says Business Manager Anu Ora.
According to her, there are plans about reforming the customer loyalty programme in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that they would start registering item information.
An experiment at first
SOK’s co-op member and customer register has already thus far been relatively comprehensive.
The basic information includes personal data and address information, but also profession, education, mode of living, as well as children's year of birth, and previous personal data.
Also the people living in the same household and their roles have been registered.
In addition, the S-Bonus partners’ information has been received from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase information will be saved in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead for the present, S-market, Prisma, Kodin Terra, and ABC chains still register the information on a product group level.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
They can forbid the use of product-level information to marketing.
For example cashiers cannot access the information, Saarikoski points out.
Gunpowder gas is the first scent we have been now practising with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the puppy.
The airport will, however, be Heila’s main work place, since the international security situation has changed on account of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused the customs to take measures, and after the attacks, control has been strengthened, says Supervision Director Mikko Grönberg from the Customs.
A school at Kirkkonummi
The Customs decide together with other authorities what scents Heila is taught to recognise.
Heila will be further trained as is necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the Customs’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
When choosing a dog for airport, the selection criteria include activeness, hunting instinct, and calmness, because the dog will deal with guns, explosives, and streams of people.
Heila, who lives with Suntio, is a close fellow worker of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There still are placement tests ahead, the next one in October, when it will be assessed whether the training is adequate for the exacting work tasks.
Their work age is about seven to eight years, possibly even ten, after which they retire to their owner’s care.
The work days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work sections only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The lucky one was Suntio, who has not had a work dog before, but he has a long experience with dogs and Customs’ supervision tasks.
Miniature state got its first Olympic medal - the people will have a holiday
According to the country’s broadcasting company, the Fiji government ratified the matter after the gold was settled.
The hero team will also have festivities in their home country.
Fiji’s rugby team celebrated the gold.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
The game was on even in a Chinese restaurants, I heard them cheering, said a Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to Guardian.
No one has really been able to say why.
His total result was 320 kilos.
RoPS acquired Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who play in men’s premier football division in Finland, has made contract until the end of the season with the Estonian forward Albert Prosa.
Little by little, Prosa began to stand out as a good option, said RoPS coach Juha Malinen in a press release.
Prosa, 25, come to RoPS from a Tallinn team Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is supposed to play with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi group meets the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new forward, when their last season’s goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Voluptuous Modern Family star causes a stir again: the teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week wearing hot pants that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actress’ legs, but also her behind.
18-Year-old Winter has lately attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour to considerably more daring.
Winter, who is on the threshold of adulthood, has lately also published several pictures of herself partying.
If the image isn’t visible, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked some experts, why Winter has changed her public image in such a radical way.
Back then, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter is experiencing a "typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
She has been on television for nearly her whole life, and she has grown up in the Kardashian era.
She has learnt that the more you show bare skin, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer said to Fox news adding that this exactly same phenomenon has already been seen countless time before.
You look amazing!
You are an inspiration to many women, a young woman praises.
The purpose of the campaign is to tempt the Japanese to begin their aurora trips already early in the autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main target group for Visit Finland’s aurora campaign are the wealthy, city-living Japanese women between 25 and 35 years, who dream about travelling and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Researchers from Aalto University and from universities of Turku and Tokyo carried out a survey, according to which Finland’s country image is exceptionally strong and positive among the Japanese when compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese do wish for clearer unique attractions from Finland, and this is where aurora have enormous potential, according to Lind.
The overnight stays of Japanese tourists have grown significantly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they overnighted in Finland over twice more than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes using tax havens.
The Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but this was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johansson, promised then to organise new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is now set to be October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict the extent of the effect the people’s rage from last spring will have on the autumn’s election result.
In June's presidential elections the criticalness towards those in power was clearly seen, and Gudni Johannesson, who came from outside the politics, was elected president.
Trump says he was being sarcastic when claiming Obama was the founder of Isis
The U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest stir-causing talks.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that the sitting president Barack Obama was the founder of terrorist organisation Isis, and that the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had also abetted in the founding of the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious about this and demanded an apology from Trump.
The mayor of Cannes in south of France has banned the use of demure burkini swimsuit favoured by the Muslims on the beaches, reports among others a British newspaper guardian.
In mid-July 85 people were killed and hundreds hurt in Nice, when a 31-year old man drove to a crowd celebrating French national holiday.
In the end of July two men, who had been connected to extremist organisation Isis, attacked a church in northern France killing a priest who was over 80 years old.
The water samples collected from the official beaches in Oulu region meet the quality demands set for swim water.
The Environmental Office of Oulu Region took water samples during Tuesday and Wednesday from the nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in Oulu region.
If the blue-green algae opacity turns into algal blooms, the issue will be reported separately also on the beach notice board.

MTK’s Hakkarainen on the forest gift deduction: Over 80 percent of the forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the next year’s budget proposal by the Ministry of Finance.
In the proposal by the Ministry of Finance, this forest gift deduction has four goals: to promote generation changes in forest holdings, to make forest owners’ age structure younger, to increase the holding sizes, and to increase the wood supply.
The goal of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make the deduction from the pure income from forest capital.
Generally speaking, the idea of doing a tool such as this to promote forest properties’ generational change is good, commented the Forestry Director Juha Hakkarainen of the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
The forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the pure capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income from which all the other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater, if the deduction could be made straight from the wood sales proceeds.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complicated.
In addition, he says, the model only affects a small part of forest owners.
This model would have an effect on about 10 per cent of forest owners, he says.
The reason behind it is the aging of forest owners.
According to MTK, at the moment, the average age of forest owners is over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A heavy hailstorm surprised the motorists at Himanka - two cars fell into a ditch and collided with each other
According to the rescue department, two cars that were driving one after another fell into a ditch, after which the car driving behind collided with the rear end of the car driving in front.
The car that was driving behind had two persons in it, and they both were taken to hospital.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove in front was not injured.
The accident happened on the main road number 8, a few kilometres from Himanka towards Kalajoki.
The observations by Academy of Finland Researcher Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of a cancer tumour increases the cancer malignancy.
Many human tissues, like breast tissue, are very soft, and the tissue cells grow as usual in an environment such as this.
According to Ivaska, it was possible to stop the cancer growth in a laboratory environment by returning the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future it may be possible to improve medical cancer treatments’ effectiveness by focussing on the communication between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in treatments.
The study results have been published 4 August in a prestigious cellular biology publication, Nature Communications.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for a foster home homicide in Muhos.
The one sentenced for manslaughter was sentenced also for aggravated endangering of road safety as a young person, and unlawful driving of a vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor demands that the man with the lighter sentenced should also be sentenced 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
According to the Court, the youth had planned an escape from the foster home at least since the previous day.
The longest-living vertebrate in the world was confirmed to be the Greenland shark, stated a study published by Science.
The female does not reproduce until its 156 years old.
Greenland shark’s life span is lengthened by the fact it grows only about 1 centimetre a year.
Some of the sharks had radioactive traces because of the nuclear tests done in the 1950s.
Based on those, the researchers were able to estimate the sharks’ age.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need the rest of the world.
The tax revenues would be reduced also with the tax concessions that benefit especially the richest ones.
Corporate tax would decrease from 35 per cent to 15 per cent.
Inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Free trade agreements would be cancelled.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo, Trump declared.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need the rest of the world:
There will be American cars driving on the streets, American planes connecting cities, American ships to patrol on seas, American steel building new skyscrapers everywhere in the country.
Economists - also those near Republicans - see Trump's programme as something that will lead the United States to a deep, economic recession.
Hillary Clinton published her own programme early on Friday Finnish time.
A tidal wave from the past - Kansan Uutiset
The sea churns fatefully, but the true tidal wave hits among Madrid’s crowds - the day of reckoning with the past can begin.
As to its level, Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere in between those two works.
She begins from the time before the daughter was born, from the moments she met the future father of the girl (Daniel Grao).
Directed and manuscript by: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The government attempts a vote trick - Kansan Uutiset
There will be no new cuts, the ministers keep on saying, so that the Finns Party would not completely collapse.
There will be no new cuts.
This is what the Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and the Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Coalition) assure before the government budget session.
This holds true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the MoF’s proposal, since the social security cuts were decided already in the spending limits session of spring.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security, and nearly all the other benefits tied to national pension index are being cut 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will shorten from 500 days to 400 days.
The education cuts continue.
Why are the ministers so eager to emphasise the very fact that there will be no new cuts on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are in April, and they, not the polls, are the most important thermometer of the electoral term.
Now it hasn’t, but over half of the party’s voters were fed up with the government policies already during the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s state of turbulence have surfaced.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year everything will most likely be different - if Sipilä’s government is still standing.
The government’s goal is to break the incurring of debts during this parliamentary term, but in Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal there is 5.9 billion euros more debt contracted next year than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to put their hands up already halfway through the electoral term and to admit that the government is unable to follow their own program: the indebtedness is not broken or even slowed down.
The second is to hold on to their program.
It is completely obvious that the current actions will not be enough to break the indebtedness, no matter how much Juha Sipilä attempts to whip up a positive atmosphere.
The graphs presented by the State Secretary Martti Hetemäki in the budgetary press conference prove it indisputably:
The world economy’s growth predictions have, again and again, turned out to be overly positive, so there will be no support from international economy.
Finnish national economy has not risen much since the crash in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy in the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment now costs 3 billion euros more annually than it did in 2008.
The graphs presented by Hetemäki show that the general government debt that crossed 60 per cent limit in 2014 will grow to 70 per cent halfway through next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected, because it was considered to be irresponsible.
Next year the maintenance of unemployment costs about 6 billion euros, the sum that is practically fully covered by contracting new debt.
This is the Centre Party’s, the Coalition Party’s, and the Finns Party’s idea of what is responsible.
A survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Three out of four thinks that organising children’s day care, youth work, and physical education should be a municipality’s responsibilities, reveals a study by KAKS - Kunnallisalan kehittämissäätiö (The Foundation for Municipal Development).
As for the province, the clearest hoped-for tasks are regional land use planning, specialised health care, vocational education, polytechnics, and institutional care for mentally disabled.
A 16-year old motorcyclist from Joensuu tried to escape from a patrol in Ilomantsintie, Joensuu, on Friday night around half past twelve.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrannantie, where it further proceeded to Sorronahontie and to a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
The driver’s breathalyser test showed a permillage of 0,75.
He also did not have a driver’s licence that would have permitted to drive on a motorcycle.
The incident is being investigated as aggravated endangering of road safety, among other things.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver away from the toppled lorry via a door above it together with the rescue helicopter personnel and the paramedics.
The police is investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly female went missing this afternoon in Ilmajoki
An 87-year old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Lahdenkylä, Ilmajoki, in Southern Ostrobothnia.
The police is looking for a good-postured woman of about 165 cm tall and slim, with white hair reaching below the chin.
All observations and hints about the missing person’s movements are asked to report to the Ostrobothnia situation centre hotline at 0295440513.
The president of Joensuu’s Parafestyhdistys, Arto Pippuri, estimated that the festival will recover financially, and the event can be arranged also next year.
On Saturday the programme will continue at 1 pm with performances in the town theatre’s facilities.
A Parafest exhibition is held at art centre Ahjo between 1 and 3 pm.
The programme will be arranged as planned.
A downburst hit Joensuu’s art museum’s backyard that was the scene for Parafest on Friday afternoon before five.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
According to a study, Londoners’ skin ages faster than normal.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
British skincare firm Caci analysed levels of the most toxic tiny particulates in London to investigate their impact on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many senior London citizens will be the equivalent of two-and-a-half years older than that of someone in the countryside.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to Evening Standard, contribute to the deaths of nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
It has been discovered in studies that the particles are small enough to penetrate the skin’s outer layer.
Inhabitants of London can attempt to protect from air pollution for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is regular cleansing.
The man did not got stuck under it, but the tractor did manage to knock the man so hard that he was badly hurt and was taken to the central hospital for further examinations.
The team has been together for nearly three weeks now.
The common language will be certainly found better than during last seasons, when the beginning of the series have been grim to Riento.
The new faces are 23-year olds Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Garchet is correspondingly a setter, and the Brazilian is 198 cm tall.
From Josba, Kataja, and Jokipojat to team USA
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every floorball world championships since 2003.
USA is creating a national team for floorball.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in the town of Elizabeth near new York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen got in to Joensuu University to study computer science.
Altogether Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the Finnish national league for women, earning a point total of 51+34=85 in 169 matches.
Her final national league level season was 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen nominated for the national team
25-year old Perttu Puska, a forward in Helsinki’s Erä, has before this played in six men's national matches, in which he has gathered a point total of 9+4=13.
The main coach of the floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontionlahti.
Beach volley virtuoso Essi Hasu’s circle closes in Kouvola - Finnish Championship gold missing from the display cabinet
Essi Hasu is about finish her career as a beach volley player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish Championships in beach volley are settled during the weekend in Kouvola’s Urheilupuisto.
In the course of three days, the medal games will be played in both adult and youth categories.
Hasu, who currently lives in Helsinki, eagerly awaits for games in front of a familiar crowd.
I started playing volleyball in Elimäen NMKY's E girls when I was nine.
In a small place, a sports club was a tight community where everyone knew each other.
Everyone’s families were strongly involved in the activities - a team mate’s father was our couch, and my mother was a long-time president of the club.
Activity at the Käyski has always been active.
Now this dream comes true, when this weekend Hasu is playing in the FC finals together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki.
Our realistic goal is a medal.
Yes, my international career will be over after Kisakallio tournament.
A downburst knocked over three tents at disabled persons’ Parafest festival in Joensuu.
According to newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there was a total of about 200 people inside the tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 5 pm.
According to the newspaper, the future of the event hangs in the balance.
The salon is set for 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Aug. 21 in the Salle Moderne at the Art Deco Southwestern School of Law, (formerly Bullocks Wilshire), 3050 Wilshire Blvd.
Advance tickets are required; SAH/SCC members, $15; non-members, $25.

Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%); furnishings, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.

So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
"I have no clue," she said.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving.
You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men, and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning "diving board."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
This single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears.
He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to crack?
For the last decade, it has been one Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have convulsed the country, spreading into more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
The government response, according to human rights groups, was ruthless.
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And its streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.
But that may be changing.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.
Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that is changing as well.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.
Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
It is true in a sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small little organization, he who called it the jayvee, totally wrong, and here's why it happened, because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
Leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other perks.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.

Chilli-powder condoms, firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
The method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
That needs no explanation.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to get access to the market.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
There's no better way to win it.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a league unto itself.
The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.
The revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that, in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
They are legitimately talented women, excelling in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.
With her reality television history, Jenner's position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she photographed to LOVE magazine.
And, in her downtime, possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids, she's on reality television.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
