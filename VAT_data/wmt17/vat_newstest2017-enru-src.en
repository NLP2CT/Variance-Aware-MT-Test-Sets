Earlier, it came to light that Putin had removed Sergei Ivanov from the post of chief of staff of the Presidential Executive Office, with Anton Vaino appointed as his successor.
Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vaino, Presidential Plenipotentiary to the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Menyailo, and Plenipotentiary to the Northwestern Federal District, Nikolai Tsukanov, were included on the Council.
Sergei Ivanov is relieved of the post of chief of staff of the Presidential Executive Office.
Sergei Ivanov is relieved of the post of head of the Kremlin administration by a presidential decree.
Anton Vaino, who previously held the post of deputy to Sergei Ivanov, is appointed the new head of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov personally asked to be transferred to another job.
Is it worth going to a health resort if you don't have any health problems?
Our expert: Head doctor of a health resort, Olga Bogush.
A health resort vacation is essential to us not only in terms of treatment, but also for the prevention of illnesses.
But about 90% of visitors feel stressed.
Moreover, the people who are most susceptible to it are from large cities and between the ages of 45 and 55.
So, if you want to spend your vacation with the children, you won't have to part ways with them.
Mild winters, long summers, and an abundance of sunny days each year (more than 300) create the perfect conditions for year-round recreation at the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
After all, the body needs rest not only during the summertime.
The main draw of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region is, of course, its healing mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Yessentuki, and Narzan.
For example, Narzan has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and repairs the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the metabolism.
Yessentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract and reduces blood sugar levels.
New Yessentuki offers anti-inflammatory, choleretic, and diuretic effects.
When prescribing water treatment, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is the Tambukan salt lake, the silt mud from which is beneficial for the joints, spine, and internal organs.
It offers anti-inflammatory, resolving, and immunomodulatory effects.
There, you can also take baths in wine, pearls, iodine-bromine, selenium, and sage-liquorice, depending on what the doctor prescribes for you.
Extending the fruiting period.
What can be done to make the harvest last until the end of the season?
Yuliya Belopukhova, an agronomist and dacha dweller, explains.
It's time to give those tall tomato plants a trim: remove the new shoots, cut off the top of the plant, and remove all the leaves up to the second-to-last cluster with fruit and blossoms with small young fruit – they won't have time to ripen.
We top-dress all tomatoes, regardless of their ‘type’, as well as peppers and eggplant, with an ash-superphosphate extract and treat them with biologicals (Dozrevatel, to speed up the ripening and growth of the fruit; Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Baktofit, to ward off diseases; Immunotsitofit, to strengthen immunity; and Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm, if there are pests).
Keep the plants uncovered during the day, but cover them after sunset.
Signs of the end.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, Russia's economic contraction slowed to 0.6% in the second quarter.
Slow growth ahead.
‘The index rating of Russia's GDP indicates that the recession is behind us, and that slow economic growth is ahead’, says a bulletin from the Bank of Russia called ‘What the trends indicate’.
But over the course of the quarter, the decline stopped: it amounted to 0.2% in April, while in May and June, the change in GDP was within the range of 0-0.15%’, RIA Novosti quotes the spokesperson from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade as saying.
The slowdown in the rate of contraction of the Russian economy over the past five quarters suggests that the ‘bottom has already been passed’.
The next argument is the increase in freight traffic, but here it's difficult to obtain accurate data, and an increase or decrease of 0.5% in semi-annual volume could also be explained by seasonal factors’, explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
For example, a decline in price pressure.
Moreover, Rosstat has recorded deflation over the past two weeks.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which indicators in the real economy should follow’, underscores Yakovenko.
In addition to this, since April, there has been growth in the volume of industrial output in the Russian Federation.
In annual terms, this figure has declined by 4.8%.
The regulatory authority has held rates at 10.5%, which doesn't have the best impact on the real sector.
Inadequate levels of investment are also a negative factor, as this hinders development of industrial capacity.
Overall, however, we can assume that by the end of the year, the rate of decline in the Russian economy will slow to -0.5%, compared to -3.7% in 2015’, says Irina Rogova, an analyst with Forex Club.
In each case, the story behind the change of nationality is different.
The young girl didn't have a choice.
There, she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister and pursue track and field.
Just like her sister, Lisa chose pole vaulting.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
Lena already started to get involved in wrestling in school.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her very first fight.
Soon thereafter, she joined the US team and made an excellent showing at the Pan American Games.
Up to that point, the girl was engaged in her favourite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
Another one of our former ‘rhythmic gymnasts’ is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who competes for Team Germany.
Jana was born in Tolyatti.
There, however, Jana was only able to take 17th place, which was not enough to get into the final competition in the individual event.
There is another gymnast, but this time, an artistic gymnast: Irina Sazonova.
Ira is an alumna of a Volgograd sport school.
In Rio, she didn't perform as well as she would have liked.
Her best placing was 40th in the individual all-around.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler, Adam Batirov, spent virtually his entire career under the Russian flag.
During that time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, Russian champion, and an international class Master of Sports of Russia.
When he stopped making it onto our national team, the time had come to start thinking about changing nationality.
Back home, there is even less known about another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, than about Swiss swimmer, Maria Ugolkova.
It is there that Mikhail started to get involved in artistic gymnastics.
In Rio, his best performance was 40th place in the qualification round on the parallel bars.
Just like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroyter competes for Team Israel.
In addition to high jump, Dmitry also does long jump and triple jump.
In Russia, he competed for the School of Higher Sports Mastery in Krasnoyarsk, and, in 2011, even became national champion.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow into the family of a member of the USSR's volleyball team, Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognised as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Khadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994, and got stuck with his family in the midst of the war.
There, Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.
And once again it's freestyle wrestling, and once again it's a former Russian citizen.
But this time, the story is about a native of North Ossetia who immigrated to Spain: it's about Taimuraz Friev.
Tired of not making it onto the team, Taimuraz decided to change sports nationality.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started to box.
Since then, Arthur has become Canadian Champion three times over, and, in 2012, he became the World Youth Champion.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.
The Chief of Staff of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation is Aton Vaino.
Previously, Sergei Ivanov held this post.
‘The head of state appointed Anton Vaino as Chief of Staff of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation by decree, relieving him of his current post’, reads a decree signed by Putin and published on the Kremlin website.
Since May 2012, Vaino has been Deputy Chief of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation.
Anton Eduardovich Vaino was born on 17 February 1972, in Tallinn.
His father, Eduard Vaino, is Chairman of the Cuba-Russia Business Council of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation and Vice President of External Relations and Cooperation with Shareholders at OAO AvtoVAZ.
In 1996, he graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Faculty of International Relations.
From October 2007 to April 2008, he was Deputy Chief of the Government Staff of the Russian Federation.
On 22 May 2012, he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation.
He is fluent in English and Japanese.
He is a Class 1 Active State Advisor to the Russian Federation (this rank was assigned by a Decree of the President of the Russian Federation on 22 January 2008)
He received a Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour (16 February 2012) for his service in support of the work of the government of the Russian Federation and many years of diligent work.
He received a Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Gratitude (24 November 2005) for his service in the preparation and implementation of celebratory events dedicated to the 60th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War.
He is married and has a son.
If Cossack classes incorporate everything positive that has been previously accumulated and take it to a whole new level, then I will be pleased.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, artificially high prices are one of the most common crimes in the sphere of housing and communal services.
While the expenses of OOO IV-Consulting (supplies cold water) show that 4 million roubles were spent hiring cars at above-market prices.
As a result, damages to the budget and residents are in the millions of roubles.
One of them carried out contractual work for a property management company, while the other two played the role of payment processing centres, that is, they took money from the population.
Cases aren't opened or drag on.
And very complicated housing legislation ‘helps’ with this, figures Svetlana Razvorotneva, Executive Director of the non-profit partnership, Housing Control.
In the rest of the cases, the investigations took on a protracted nature, and every fifth case was suspended in connection with failure to identify the accused party.
The law exists, but inquiry bodies are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
Primarily, due to the eradication of corruption, in and of itself, throughout the state, assures Anton Zharkov, a member of the Duma Committee on property issues.
It's not just isolated actions: it's a deliberate policy of fighting corruption.
Why are there no such scandals in the housing and communal services sector in Moscow, as there are in many other regions?
Well, because the city government has shown an iron will and has established order, Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the Duma Committee for security and combating corruption, told AiF.
Plus, Moscow checks the reasonableness of rates for housing and communal services, because a sizeable portion of budgetary funds goes towards subsidies and benefits for a multitude of population categories.
Perhaps the weak-willed should change jobs?
Can Erdogan forgo a friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has given an ultimatum to the United States, demanding a choice be made between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organising the coup.
He announced this while speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdoğan urged the Americans to withdraw support for the Fethullah Terrorist Organisation.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States is urged to change its position.
They must make this choice’, the Anatolian Agency quotes Erdoğan as saying in an appeal made on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but this time more sternly, urged the United States to comply with his demand, which he first voiced immediately after quelling the rebellion.
According to Recep Erdoğan, Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States, acted as their mentor.
According to him, the introduction of amendments to the anti-terrorism law by Ankara, as required by the EU, would put the internal security of Europe at risk.
Note that, on 1 August, Sigmar Gabriel, Vice Chancellor of Germany, demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with threats to open the borders to migrants, in order to achieve a simplification of the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to a corresponding statement from Turkey’s Foreign Minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country would consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if they didn't receive the expected support from it.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the area of defence, that import missiles’, Çavuşoğlu stated in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey, from now on, needs to create its own defence system based on its own technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
‘Up until now, Turkey had been trying to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have been disappointing, and we have started to look for other partners’, the minister said.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to have a completely obedient person in this post’, the expert explained to AiF.
I think that Erdoğan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Having found himself between the two poles of the West and Russia, he will try to seek maximum benefit for himself’, Mukhin believes.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached’, the expert believes.
A different point of view is espoused by Anna Glazova, Head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East.
It's no accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claim they are willing to change their stance on a whole range of issues related to Syria, differences with Israel have been settled, and active political engagement with Iran is currently underway’, Glazova explained to AiF, suggesting that Erdoğan's next step will be the normalisation of relations with Egypt.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will continue to evolve and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's position both in the regional and international arena’, the expert believes.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
There was the handshake, yes.
I lost count.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson sacked after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to come at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power.
The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world turns.
That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade.
Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.
Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).
Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
A generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.
Some people are even making new friends on the hunt.
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.
So what?
A breakthrough has occurred.
The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.

Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
It's not a coincidence.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle, the report states.
Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks.
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."
But it's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.
It gets better.
You know it will get better for you.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.
His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.
Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This one is on track to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This is powerful.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.

Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.
But the experiment, which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results.
By comparison, freshly washed hands should come in under 60.
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'
Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
In Saint Petersburg, inspections of businesses, by Rospotrebnadzor, for compliance with these standards started in February 2015.
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost a company 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.
At that time, the issue at stake was the safety of food for astronauts.
Unfortunately, for a long time, we were convinced that the standard only applied to food production and not restaurateurs, explained Elena Tsereteli, Head of the Public Council.
Now, everyone is trying to make up for lost time.
But this won't lead to a spike in demand, since the core market, families with children, are already getting ready for school, experts point out.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday with a request to now allow charters.
‘For many Russian tourists, selecting affordable, quality seaside vacations is still an unresolved issue, because, in the resort towns of Krasnodar Krai and the Republic of Crimea, the majority of accommodation facilities are already booked up until the end of September’, note the authors of the letter, while emphasising that the establishment of charter operations in August would not significantly affect existing demand for Russian seaside tourism products.
There is still no clear understanding of when charters will resume; it ultimately depends on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes could start flying in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly put together packages and reach an agreement with airline companies regarding the required flight paths’, says said Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects for the North-West Division Office of RUTI.
Charter packages can count on those who have the ability to spontaneously take a vacation’, says Pavel Rumyantsev.
‘Turkey has a chance to attract lots of tourists if it provides very budget-friendly offers – 50-60 thousand roubles for a trip for two – because there are people who intentionally wait for very cheap tours’, says Valery Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel travel agency.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, because there is demand for scheduled flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no sense in expecting a buying frenzy.
‘For Turkey, the launch of charters right now is a rehearsal for next season’, says Pavel Rumyantsev.
‘The establishment of charters to Turkey is good news for the next season’, agrees Valeriya Rubtsova.

Moscow's Gazstroibank has lost its license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations from the credit institution, Joint Stock Commercial Bank GAZSTROIBANK, which is registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK, pursued a high-risk lending policy related to the investment of funds in low-quality assets.
Furthermore, the credit institution was involved in dubious transit transactions.
A temporary administration has been appointed at the bank for a period of validity up until the appointment of the bankruptcy manager or liquidator.
JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
It bears reminding that, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ ‘On the insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation’, insurance payouts to bank depositors, including sole traders, covers 100% of the remaining balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per depositor.
According to accounting statements, as of 1 August 2016, JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK held 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation in terms of assets.

Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
Rospotrebnadzor reported this, writes M24.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of the Moscow Department of Rospotrebnadzor, and it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a statement that names the second person suspected of organising subversive activities in Crimea.
They include Evgeny Alexandrovich Panov and Andrei Romanovich Zakhtei.
'All of them are giving a confession', the statement said.
Earlier, Evgeny Panov, a resident of Zaporozhsky Region, who was detained on suspicion of organising acts of terrorism in Crimea, admitted his guilt during an interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future’, stated Alexei Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.
During the investigation, the FAS established that Google is only supplying manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia with the Google Play app store on the condition that the corporation's other applications will also be installed on the device.
The search engine, which must be placed on the home screen of the smartphone, is listed among these applications.
The law “On Protection of Competition” must be followed by all companies whose products are available in the Russian Federation, including transnational corporations’, noted Elena Zaeva, Head of the Department for Regulating Communications and Information Technologies at the FAS of Russia.
The New Book chain was fined for selling the book, ‘50 days until my suicide’.
The New Book chain of stores was fined for selling Stace Kramer's book, ‘50 days until my suicide’, Moscow City News Agency reports.
As reported by Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be seen as 'encouraging or motivating suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents'.
The Ostankino District Court confirmed the violation of specified requirements for the distribution of information products among children and ruled to impose penalty in the form of a fine and confiscation of 49 copies of the printed product, which were seized by the Rospotrebnadzor directorate.
In March of this year, it was reported that inspections for the presence of the book, ‘50 days until my suicide’, were being conducted at the largest bookstores in Moscow.
An evening in memory of Ernst Neizvestny will be held in Moscow.
An evening in memory of the sculptor, Ernst Neizvestny, will be held in Moscow, TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August, at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to Neizvestny, face-to-face, in the United States.
As such, it was decided to organise this evening for those who would like to remember him in his native land’, stated the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
Close friends of Neizvestny have been invited to the evening event, including: the poet, Yevgeny Yevtushenko; the artist, Boris Messerer; President of the Pushkin Museum, Irina Antonova; the director, Mark Rozovsky; as well as Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky; Head of the Department of Culture for Moscow, Alexander Kibovsky; and Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier, it was reported that Ernst Neizestny's relatives plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably before 14 August.
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."
So, let's take a look.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I suppose I am," he says.
It's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
From conversations I've had, people have got rid of their collection, normally around 1998 or 1999.
"We're like their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."
While the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop, rather than noodling jazz, is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
It costs a lot.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classics, the essential records for any average collection.
They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
On 11 August, Library Branch No. 1 will hold a local history hour, ‘I live in this city; I know this city’.

While, at Library Branch No. 4 in Surazhevka, there will be a play-based programme called, ‘Film, film, film’.
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
As he said, it was touch and go.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really important not to get carried away.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
The government has extended the deadline for the destruction of food products prohibited from entering Russia until the end of 2017.
On the hunt for ‘prohibited goods’
Rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
A weather front that will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature will pass through the capital region.
Rain with thunderstorms is also forecast for Oryol, Kursk, and Voronezh Regions, Dni.ru reports.
Precipitation is unlikely for the upcoming workweek.
A WTO panel of arbitrators has found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators, and palm oil contravene the rules of the organisation.
'This is the first time that the WTO has decided against Russia', says a statement on the official website of the organisation.
However, the arbitrators pointed out in their conclusion that the EU has not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures ‘were systematic' or 'were overarching in nature'.
This is noted in a statement from the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.
This is stated in a complaint from the Government of Ukraine.
The WTO is an international organisation, founded in January 1995, for the liberalisation of international trade.
Russia joined it in 2012.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Sergei Ivanov's former deputy, Anton Vaino, as head of his administration.
Vladimir Putin carried out the reshuffling of the Executive Office of the President and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would facilitate the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
The state-owned Polish Oil and Gas Company, PGNIG, has not ruled out the possibility that, in a few years, the supply of gas from Russia could become unappealing to it, as a result of a reorientation towards fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by Bohuslav Marzec, Vice President of Finance for the Polish company.
TASS quotes him as saying this.
‘It may just happen that we will no longer buy any gas (from Gazprom); we are currently diversifying our supply.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supply for us will be from the East, raw materials from LNG terminals, and Norway’, said Marzec.
Currently, Gazprom occupies the dominant position in gas shipments to Poland.
Recall that, on 22 July, Poland's antimonopoly agency denied the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
This was stated by Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Board for the holding.
According to him, Warsaw is planning to build the Baltic Pipe, a new LNG supply terminal, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 calls for the construction of two lines of off-shore pipelines running from Russia to Germany under the Baltic sea, with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year.
The Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) of the OSCE has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was announced by Principal Deputy Chief of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
'I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area', he said in answer to a corresponding question from journalists, RIA Novosti reports.
The video recording was posted by 360 TV.
The incident occurred at 4:30 a.m. Moscow time.
The KrasAvia airline flight was en route from Sochi.
The aircraft itself was transported to the apron.
Ufa airport is operating as per usual.
A UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny using chlorine gas, however, UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, considers the fact of what happened to be indisputable.
‘A few minutes later, I could smell the gas, my eyes started to burn, and it became difficult to breathe’, the publication quotes the witness as saying.
UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: ‘there is a lot of evidence that this actually did take place’.
The prohibition of the use of chlorine gas for military purposes is spelled out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
In spite of the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny using toxic gases, in 2015, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the Syrian army using chlorine gas against the ‘moderate opposition’.
Staffan de Mistura's advisor for humanitarian affairs, Jan Egeland, stated that, in order to deliver aid into the city and evacuate the sick and wounded, a 48-hour cease-fire every week would be required.
‘We have to send bulk cargo in convoys of trucks into an area where the roads are virtually destroyed and those that remain are mined’, reported Mr Egeland. But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table’.
How Russia opened ‘humanitarian windows’ in Aleppo.
The creation of ‘humanitarian windows’ is intended to enable the delivery of medicine, food, and basic necessities into the city.
All at once, several explosions rocked southern Thailand on Friday morning.
14 million people have already visited the country in 2016, 1.5 million more than the figure for 2015.
The first individuals suspected of preparing and organising the attacks have already been detained, reported Police Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.
It's too early to draw conclusions, said Mr Patanacharoen.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sirikit.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its main priorities, so the incident was most likely directed against it.
According to the Royal Thai Police, they include four citizens of Germany, three Dutch nationals, two citizens of Italy, and one citizen of Austria.
There were no Russian citizens among the victims of the explosions, the press service of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency reported.
It was prepared by the constitution drafting committee appointed by the military junta.
How Bangkok ended up in a state of emergency
The development of terms has begun in Sukhoi Log.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has submitted to the government a draft of the regulation and auction terms for the world's largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, with 130 million ounces in reserves and resources), said two of Kommersant's sources who are familiar with the situation.
The representative in charge of subsoil use, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, told Kommersant that the official's administrative office has not yet received the draft.
‘The auction could be announced as early as August, immediately after a government order is issued, and given the timeframe for the submission of applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender could take place as early as October’, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment said.
The first is that bidders must have a minimum of 25% state participation in their capital.
‘But this is in the spirit of the times: to not hand over control of the largest gold deposits in Russia amidst Western sanctions’, argues a Kommersant source familiar with the auction’s preparations.
Kommersant's sources consider it highly unlikely the government will adjust the terms.
The industry front-runner for Sukhoi Log is believed to be a consortium of the largest gold mining company in the Russian Federation, PJSC Polyus (which is controlled by Suleiman Kerimov's son, Said), and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July, the partners established a joint venture, CL Gold, which gives Polyus 51% of the shares, and the structure, Rostec RT-Global Resources, 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, while Polyus told Kommersant that ‘definitely, they are interested in the asset’ and possess all the necessary expertise and resources for its development.
‘But a final decision on the feasibility and form of our participation will be made after the announcement of terms’, Polyus added.
Russia's GV Gold and Canada's Kinross Gold, which is developing assets in Chukotka Region, have also announced the possibility of participating in the development of Sukhoi Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
Sergei Kashuba, Chairman of the Russian Union of Gold Producers, told Kommersant in December 2015, that investments in Sukhoi Log were valued at between $2.5 and 4 billion.
The majority of potential bidders are deterred not only by the investment amount, but also by the complexity of the project: extensive in-mine exploration of reserves and methods for working with complex ores are required, Kommersant's sources in the industry explain.
As a result of the merger, NPF Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the compulsory pension insurance market.
As of 31 March, the volume of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
Currently, this combined NPF is absorbing the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
‘Merging into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for solving structural problems’, notes the CEO of NPF Future, Nikolay Sidorov.
In 2017, NPF Doverie will join them.
The pause in merging funds that KIT Finance Pension Administrator took could have been caused by several factors, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not redeem more than 40% of the volume of an issue of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively involved.
After amendments were made to the Central Bank resolution in March of this year, there are no longer any such restrictions for a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.
Several heads of the top-15 NPFs by assets named the division of spheres of influence, and, as a result, the appointment of staff in a single fund, which had to be agreed to by the owners of the group, as yet another possible reason for the pause.
NPF Gazfond also did not respond to Kommersant's request.
Moreover, the successful experience of NPFs, KIT Finance and Promagrofond, in generating retail sales of compulsory pension insurance and in using more modern software, will be in demand.
The Central Bank's requirements for the activities and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, so it is impractical to duplicate the infrastructure of the four funds given their unified investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.
‘The effect of cutting out duplicate functions will definitely cover the potential costs of the merger’, notes Mr Mitrofanov.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honour of a puppy from a book of fairy tales, plays tag with him, and falls asleep in his embrace.
Six years later, with a beard and in a loincloth, he is indistinguishable from that other clever forest rascal, Mowgli.
It is in this state that he is found by the redheaded huntress, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while a team led by Gavin (Karl Urban), the brother of her husband, is aggressively clearing the forest.
None of the characters look or act too horribly for the audience to really start to hate or fear them.
The dragon amusingly grunts, purrs, and even snorts, but, thankfully, does not speak; although, the whole time, you want to be petting him, and it is in this sense that he has an obvious advantage over all the other known cinematic dragons.
How did Director David Lowery manage to shoot a fantastically lovable remake of the forgotten Disney film, ‘Pete's Dragon’ (1977), – which was mediocre from start to finish and only remembered for combining animation and live-action film – and turn it into this summer's most heartwarming film?
Nothing short of a miracle would have helped.
The musical numbers and most of the odd jokes were thrown overboard.
A new charge will be brought against RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov
She related that the prosecutor's office pointed out to the investigators the discrepancy between the classification of the case and the materials collected.
Now, investigators will have to bridge the gaps in the body of evidence and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
As Kommersant reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
Kommersant-Boscosport correspondent, ALEXANDER ZILBERT, lived the life of an Olympic athlete in the Olympic Village, inspected Team Russia House, had lunch at the on-site cafeteria, and, after all of this, even passed a WADA test.
It seems that life here never stops for a second.
Even at night.
We usually discuss certain mundane operational issues at these meetings, recounts Igor Kazikov, Head of the Sports Delegation of the Russian Olympic Team. In spite of the fact that the building where our people have been housed is considered to be a showpiece – it was one of the first to be commissioned and was shown to all the inspectors – even here, certain deficiencies are constantly being found.
At first, no one was even showing up to clean.
Their floors, can't you see, are somehow innovative.
Sure, we know these kinds of floors: ordinary laminate flooring!
In sum, we successfully managed to switch cleaning companies and now everything seems to be OK with this.
Well, for security, there is also a two-metre iron fence around the whole perimeter, along which guards, armed with automatic weapons, stroll.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3,604 apartments, located inside 31 buildings.
Two notices are hanging at the front desk: a printed one, ‘Please, do not throw paper in the toilet!’, and a hand-written one, ‘I will accept pins as gifts’.
The front desk itself is buried under pamphlets.
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
They are only believed by those who are afraid.
And to further raise one's spirits, there hangs an announcement: ‘Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of his Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeev will perform spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic Team.
Prayer service and other religious rites can be ordered by phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Ceremonies for representatives of all faiths within the village.
By all accounts, it was the staff from the new cleaning company sleeping.
By and large, there is nothing to complain about, the honoured coach of Russia shares his impressions. We live two to a room, the beds, of course, are almost right up against each other, but it's not critical.
‘No, well, can you imagine it? They've run out of tea!’, tennis player, Svetlana Kuznetsova, who met me in the main dining room, says while throwing her hands up in dismay.
The menu options include: ‘The Best of Brazil’, ‘Global Cuisine’, ‘Asian Dishes’, and ‘Pizza and Pasta’.
It's a good thing I brought some Chinese tea to brew with me.
And a teapot.
I personally chose the steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
They're luring them in, you could say!
The situation already took a turn for the worse by the second question: ‘If I received a notification to report to doping control, should I report immediately to the doping control centre?’
I settled on option B: ‘No, I have one hour’.
Well, by the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation had become entirely critical.
But alas, they won't allow it!
That WADA doesn't play fair!
‘So, how's it going, Russia?’, the presenter of the quiz mockingly questions.
I got caught up with counting the fitness machines.
I noted with surprise that there was not a single Russian athlete to be found among this mass of treadmills.
But maybe that's the way it should be?
Let those who don't know how to play be the ones who train!
In line to see the optometrist.
Don't worry; he's not a shooter.
I took one for myself, as a memento.
But, if you walk and don't get a ride in the electric cars, you will discover Team Canada House with a moose at the entrance and a pavilion with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundromat, and a dry cleaners, and a hair salon, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a post office with unique stamps (only you won't be able to wait out the queue of Chinese stamp collectors anyways), and a bank, and a lost and found, and a photo booth.
And you, to the accompaniment of a device randomly spraying a liquid to kill insects, will think about eternity.
That is to say, about the Olympic movement.
And threateningly moving the furniture.
In the kitchen, the faucet is leaking: there hasn't been time to drive to the market and buy a new one like the plumber requested.
TV series are broadcast live on there.
The Australians were an equal match, and, as a matter of fact, they won the first half.
I start flipping through the channels in a slight panic.
There is no fencing on any of the specialty Match channels.
But, I have a feeling that the bout is just about to start.
The spastic channel surfing produces an unexpected but brilliant result.
I click on fencing and get the battle for the gold.
Deriglazova mounts a terrific counterattack, moves ahead in points, and, quite obviously, starts to run out the clock.
The Italian claws back almost all of the lead.
Victory!
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar ‘won't reach the entire audience’.
As stated by the Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin, this should become an incentive to young Tatars ‘to learn their native language’.
‘For those who will say that it is “difficult”, we intend to organise absolutely free Tatar language lessons at each of the large mosques’, Mr Samigullin promised.
An imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, ‘can use them to thoroughly prepare’.
In particular, as indicated by the mufti, this was the practice at Burnaevskaya Mosque, Zakabannaya Mosque, and at ‘Eniler’.
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the WCT, Rinat Zakirov, told Kommersant: ‘the mosque is an important part of our national life’.
Both Tatars and Russians attend mosque.
‘We're going to have to change our ways’, says the Imam of Burnaevskaya Mosque, Farhat Mavletdinov.
Allah will show us the way out of this situation’, he concluded.
‘That is why we switched to the Russian language four years ago’, the imam says.
But we will abide by the decision of the plenum.
‘For example, it will only be easier for me, because Tatar is my native language’, concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.
The capital’s prosecutor's office referred the criminal case against the former director of the FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise (FSUE), Centre for Information Technology and Communications of the Federal Penitentiary Service (TSITOS), Victor Opredelenov, to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court.
Depending on their role and degree of participation in the crimes, they are accused by the Main Investigations Directorate of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for Moscow under Article 285(3) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers entailing grave consequences), and Article 159(4) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using one's official position, in an organised group, on an especially large scale).
Furthermore, Krivolapov is charged under Article 222(1) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
To embezzle the budgetary funds, the members of the group developed a scheme whereby FSUE TSITOS, an enterprise controlled by them and with whom relevant government contracts were signed, handled the technical means of control and surveillance, including ‘electronic bracelets’, and charged prices that were inflated several times over.
In spite of the fact that FSUE TSITOS had no production equipment, buildings, or structures to house the production facilities necessary to create a complete production cycle for ‘electronic bracelets’, five contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were signed between it and the FSIN of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles ended up in the accounts of the Samara branch of the FSUE, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
In regards to this case, the size of which amounted to 133 tomes, FSIN has filed a lawsuit against the accused for compensation of material damages in the amount of 2.7 billion roubles.
Footballer Hakan Şükür is suspected of involvement in the coup.
A star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Şükür is wanted by authorities in connection with the coup attempt that took place last month.
This is in reference to the Hizmet Movement: a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious and opposition leader, Fethullah Gülen.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to investigators, in addition to Hakan Şükür, his father was also part of Fethullah Gülen's organisation.
He spent the better part of his career with Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italy's Torino, Inter, and Palermo, as well as England's Blackburn.
In 2013, Hakan Şükür resigned from his parliamentary post as a result of the initiation of corruption investigations surrounding Erdogan's party and his inner circle.
They are accused of aiding the military coup and having ties to the oppositionist Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen, who is living in the United States.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a chain of cinemas that are only for domestic films.
Mr Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete with major Hollywood films for viewership.
‘And it's even very difficult for them to compete with “Transformers” and “Iron Man”, the promotion of which are pumped up with huge budgets’, the film director said.
It bears reminding that, on 1 July, the Tavrida All-Russian Educational Youth Forum started working in Crimea.
The British women, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, won Olympic gold in pairs rowing.
New Zealanders, Rebecca Scone and Genevieve Beren, took silver, and Anne Andersen and Hedvig Rasmussen from Denmark came in third place.
Kommersant-News: The new general contractor promises to deliver Zenit Arena by 26 December.
‘Today, Russia’s Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, and I visited the construction site, and Vadim Alexandrov, General Director of Metrostroy, was with us.
Vitaly Mutko and I were impressed by what we saw and heard’, the agency quotes its source as saying.
Vitaly Mutko arrived in Saint Petersburg earlier in order to inspect the venue for the upcoming large-scale competitions.
To recap, yesterday, it came to light that the company, Metrostroy, would complete construction of Zenit Arena; the value of the contract amounts to approximately 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won the bid for the improvement of areas around the stadium, with a contract value of 2.4 billion roubles. The contracts with JSC Corporation Transstroy, JSC Engineering Corporation Transstroy-SPB, and JSC Engineering Corporation Transstroy were terminated.
For more information about the choice of the new general contractor, read the following Kommersant material: ‘Metrostroy has been let onto the pitch’.
In Miass (Chelyabinsk Region), Konstantin Akulich, the lawyer for the former Vice Governor, Nikolai Sandakov, has been detained.
‘Initially, it was filed against unidentified persons. Then, after he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulich’, says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulich became the ex-vice governor's lawyer at the beginning of August.
To recall, two criminal cases were brought against Nikolai Sandakov.
The second criminal case concerns bribes that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from Igor Kalugin, the director of the private security company, Python, in the form of property-related services worth no less than 1.3 million roubles, which were provided illegally at no charge.
For more information about Mr Sandakov, read the following Kommersant material: ‘Former vice governor requests the consolidation of his cases’.
Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is evidenced, for example, by the fact that RMK took on the modernisation of one of the country’s oldest and most ecologically ‘dirty’ enterprises: the Karabash copper smelter.
The Karabash copper smelter was founded by an English joint-stock company, headed by Leslie Urquhart, in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was an industrial enterprise significant to the country's economy and effectively ensured the livelihoods of the entire city.
In 1998, a decision was made to resume operations at Karabash copper smelter.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmed started to change in 2004, after the enterprise came under the management of Russian Copper Company.
According to Vsevolod Levin, President of Russian Copper Company, the volume of investments in this project amounted to around 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of modernisation at ZAO Karabashmed is the reconstruction of converter processing.
Over the entire duration of the Tominskiy Mining and Processing Plant project, from the start of construction up until the commissioning of the second phase of the project, the Federal Treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
Over the first year of production in Varnensky District, 346.3 million roubles were paid into the budgets of different levels of government.
‘The longer the enterprise successfully operates, the more money it can contribute’, added Valery Ulanovsky.
However, the involvement of RMK's enterprises in the life and development of the areas of their operations is not limited to tax contributions.
The grounds at RMK Arena will also feature a landscaped park with an artificial pond, underground and surface parking for 600 cars, cafes, and sports shops.

It should be presented to a working group headed by First Deputy Prime Minister, Igor Shuvalov, in early autumn, says Vedomosti's source in the MKS.

The FAS has fined Google almost half a billion roubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile applications market.
The antitrust proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
Following the results of the inquiry, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to penalise Google, said Alexey Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the ruling entering into force.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service declared the company to be in violation of the competition law back in September of last year and ordered them to adjust their contracts by 18 December.
The current course of action is leading nowhere.
This is the view expressed to Echo of Moscow by Eldar Murtazin, a leading analyst with Mobile Research Group.
The total damages amounted to 84 thousand roubles.
Soon thereafter, the guardians of order were hot on the thief’s trail.
Now he will have to answer for the theft to the fullest extent of the law: a criminal case has been opened in relation to the man in custody.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.

Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.
Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Forward motion is not the goal.
He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
For the last decade, it has been one Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
The government response, according to human rights groups, was ruthless.
Videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall.
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.
But that may be changing.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.
For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that is changing as well.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
The latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The coffee is still good, too.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.
There are brown-rice bowls.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003.
The new location has other perks.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
The detention of defendants in the case of a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery has been extended to 14 November
Presnensky Court is keeping defendants in the case of a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery in detention until 14 November, having granted a corresponding request from investigators.
There are 14 defendants in this case.
Recall that, on 14 May, there was a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery between hundreds of immigrants from Central Asia and the North Caucasus, which involved the use of weapons and resulted in the deaths of three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yury Chabuev, and a lawyer and co-founder of the public organisation, Healthy Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organising murder.
The matter of the second indexation of pensions in 2016, could be decided in the next two to three weeks.
All the calculations have been made.
Right now, economists are taking stock of the past six months and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks’, Interfax quotes Golodets as saying.
At the end of July, news broke that the government had agreed on a policy to fully index pension benefits in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan made it into the final of the smallbore rifle shooting competition.
Turkish oppositionist, Fethullah Gülen, calls for an international investigation into the circumstances surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey.
‘I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt’, the French newspaper, Le Monde, quotes Gülen as saying.
The Turkish oppositionist also said that, ‘if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey’.
Earlier, the Istanbul Court issued an in absentia arrest warrant for the oppositionist Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.

Chilli-powder condoms, firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
Previously many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
One whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.
This information was presented by Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, in a discussion with local journalists.
Recall that a coup attempt took place in Turkey in July.
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
Lanzmann wrote.
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia & Iran surges 71% - RT Business
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
The state continues to tighten the screws on the military-industrial complex.
‘Systematic failure to implement’ the orders of the director general of Almaz-Antey Concern, ‘shortcomings in work’, and ‘a loss of trust’ were the grounds for the dismissal.
How can such silence in the face of a major rearmament of the military be explained?
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event from the perspective of restoring order in the industry.
The Almaz Scientific Production Association is the concern's principal enterprise, which specialises in the production of sea and land-based air defence missile systems (ADMS).
Currently, Almaz is working on the development of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus ADMSs, which are slated to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers, and cruisers.
Dmitry Kornev, founder of the internet portal, Military Russia, believes that Neskorodov's dismissal was brought about by a failure to meet the delivery deadlines for these projects.
This theory is the most logical.
According to the information I'm receiving, over several years of testing, there hasn't been a single truly successful test.
The expert fears that a delay could also occur in the commissioning of the S-500 ADMS.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional abilities of Neskorodov, who had been in charge of Almaz since 2011.
The industry received long-term contracts worth tens of billions of roubles, and, as is well know, big money loves peace and quiet.
As a rule, directors of defence companies resign from a post of their own accord, according to an agreement of mutual understanding between the parties, or are transferred to another job.
During the Cold War, the military might of the USSR and nuclear parity reached in the 1970s, led to the signing of the Helsinki Pact, which cemented Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
In such circumstances, the only allies our country has left are the navy and the army.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Because, with a spot on Vogue's September issue, we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian.
The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.
With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 of last year's 832-page tome as advertising content).
Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."
But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in pretty good company.
They are legitimately talented women, excelling in the entertainment industry.
Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.

But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013.
The company is going after ad blockers on desktop however, because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Two agencies are conducting an investigation into the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea, Kommersant writes.
As previously reported, a confession was made by Evgeny Panov, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armyansk, the oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields as potential targets for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that far from all of the saboteurs' accomplices have been apprehended.
This, in particular, served as grounds for arrest of the suspects at the Kiev District Court in Simferopol, the publication notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov has become the head coach of the Russian national football team
A decision was made at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
On 11 August, the Executive Committee of the RFU appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
He is a well-known footballer, who formerly played for Spartak Moscow in the position of goalkeeper, and is also a coach with solid experience, who was the trainer for such Russian teams as the one and very same Spartak, Zhemchuzhina-Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dynamo, and also Legia Warsaw, which won the national championship and the country's cup.
It's known that Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintaras Staučė, and Vladimir Panikov will be part of his coaching staff.
There is information that suggests that the salaries for the whole coaching staff will amount to 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to media sources, the leadership of the RFU has set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to get the Russian national team to the semi-finals and to win medals.
The Russian team will have its first match under the direction of Cherchesov on 31 August, in Antalya: it will be a friendly match against the Turkish team.
Sandwiched between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
Furthermore, governments are often advised to introduce fees for education for the purpose of ‘cost recovery’.
Efforts to eliminate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past ten years.
Compared to the figure for 1993, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard measure of inequality in income distribution, fell by 15 points.
Namibia also has the highest rating for freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is significantly ahead of the United States and other wealthy countries.
Additionally, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is compiled by human rights activists from Transparency International.
Namibia, of course, faces some difficulties that are typical of underdeveloped economies.
Almost immediately after attaining independence, the authorities got to work on creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions came together to work for the common good.
In addition to this, the Namibian government rightly decided that rich natural resources can just as easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
As the head of state, Hage Geingob, noted, the media often says things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia needs to protect the freedoms it has gained, the President says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are non-renewable.
Some of them, such as the fishing industry, are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Its achievements deserve international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard about the ‘Varna Gold’, the earliest gold objects created by man (4600-4200 BC).
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunatsite is located inland, near the village of Yunatsite in Pazardzhik District.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, leader of the excavation at Tell Yunatsite, has dated the find at 4600 BC and said that it's older than the gold of Varna by at least 200 years.
So, where is the certainty about which gold is more ancient coming from?
This will help to date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements started to emerge around the metalworking centres.
Now they are called the most ancient cities of Europe.
Tell Yunatsite is quite possibly the most ancient of them all, given that artefacts from 4900 BC have been found here.
‘This place is older than Sumer by a thousand years’, says Boyadzhiev, bearing in mind the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in Southern Mesopotamia, which is modern Iraq.
That is where the first cities, in the usual sense of the word, arose.
The excavation of Tell Yunatsite has been underway since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about one third of the total estimated area of the settlement.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the ‘Bird City’: dozens of clay bird figurines were found here.
The ‘Bird City’ was destroyed around 4100 BC, possibly by Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
The nomads didn’t have cities, but did have horses and weapons.
The three-metre-high fortress walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of a brutal massacre: the remains of elderly people, women, and children, with evidence of wounds inflicted by battle-axes, were found inside of the houses.
Porsche has artificially aged the 911 Targa model
It is equipped with a 3.0-litre, six-cylinder turbocharged engine, producing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released as a limited edition, but neither the number, nor the cost of each specific sports car have been reported.
Facebook and ad blockers have unleashed an ‘arms race’
AdBlock Plus has released an ‘antidote’, but Facebook plans on making even this useless before long.
In this way, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of ‘arms race’, trying to one-up each other: the aggrieved party turned out to be the users, who missed interesting posts from their friends or saw advertisements where they weren't used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertisements have caused heated arguments as of late.
A rapist will stand trial in Murmansk · Vecherniy Murmansk.
The investigation established that, at the end of November 2015, the accused committed sexual battery against a 20-year-old young woman in the vicinity of Pavlov Street in Murmansk. A criminal case, with an approved indictment, has been submitted for consideration on merits.
The penalty for this article provides for a maximum punishment of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring the Fengguang 370 crossvan and the Rich New pickup truck to Russia – Za Rulem website www.zr.ru
The Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is representative of a class of automobiles, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover, which is gaining popularity in China.
Another new model announced for Russia is the Rich New pickup truck.
Five of the seven seats easily fold to produce a flat loading area with a length of 1,650 mm, while the maximum trunk capacity is 1,500 L.
The Fengguang 370 is fitted with just one 1.5 L gasoline ‘aspirated’ engine, with 115 hp of output, connected to a 5-speed manual transmission.
Currently, Dongfeng's Russian line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail – Za Rulem website www.zr.ru
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
It bears reminding that, this year, the transport tax must be paid by 1 December.
The mail out of notifications began in July.
But the controversial concept did not confound the experts at the company, G-Power, who tackled the redesign of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
Mind you, acceleration at average speeds is, for sure, discernibly easier for it.
Mercedes-Benz intends to compete with the ‘green sub-brand’, BMW i, and will promote their electric models under a separate brand.
