28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Over the past six years, the state-owned rail operator has invested over 31 billion Czech crowns in the upgrade of train carriages.
Save for 2012, the annual amounts spent on modernisation have been steadily decreasing.
However, upgraded older carriages are counted towards the indicator as brand new.
Without the upgraded vehicles, the average age of traction vehicles of ČD would increase by ten years.
Under the contract, it plans to purchase up to 30 motorised units and up to 20 electric-powered units.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for several months but they seem powerless to stop it.
The editorial staff of the online news provider Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now woos motorists to visit Lipno to take a stroll among the treetops or through the Olympic park.
There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of similar ads all across the country.
The Road and Motorway Directorate admitted a few months ago that there was an illegal billboard on their property near the busy national road between České Budějovice and the Lipno dam.
It seems as if nobody cared that it was standing right next to the road, in the fifty-metre protection zone, which must be kept free for safety reasons.
Road operators argue that they cannot deal with the billboard because of legal loopholes.
An option would be simply to load in onto a truck and take it away.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which Aktuálně.cz started monitoring in spring, is not unique and points to a general problem which the authorities are unable to handle effectively and efficiently.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial staff found dozens of similar portable adverts located illegally alongside the road or in its close proximity.
"We find it difficult to force companies to remove the billboards," said the head of the transport department of the regional authority in České Budějovice Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are handling similar cases.
According to Klása, loopholes in the law which ties the hands of officials are to blame.
First, they are required to contact the billboard owners in a bureaucratic way to remove the advert.
The bosses of the companies are often impossible to get hold of or they use the trick, Aktuálně.cz already reported on when they looked into the matter: move the portable stand with advert just a few metres away and the order to remove the illegal billboard is not worth the paper it is written on.
This is because the authority is required to specify the location of the illegal billboard.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates change it is considered to be a new billboard, and we have to approach the owner again," said Klasa.
Officials are familiar with this company as the municipality of České Budějovice is currently conducting three separate administrative proceedings against the company for illegal billboards.
The company could be fined up to three hundred thousand Czech crowns in each case.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, said Jaroslav Mráz, said the head of the transport department of the municipality of České Budějovice.
While the billboard followed by Aktuálně.cz is not yet among these cases, this is likely to change soon.
According to the spokeswoman of the Road and Motorway Directorate, Nina Ledvinová, the company does not respond to repeated written demands and the case will in all likelihood land on the table of regional and later municipal authorities.
Commerz Billboard is among the suspicious companies that are difficult to contact.
The company does not collect its mail and it has closed its official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
In the past, the company's mail was sent to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, whose claim to fame is the bitter dispute with the head of the Czech representation of Hyundai.
This seems to be a futile exercise.
Lack of transparency with respect to the change of addresses are not uncommon..
A few years ago, we fined one company two million Czech crowns in total.
We are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices.
Nobody is yet looking to amend the law.
Aktuálně.cz spoke with several MPs, who have shown interest in the problem,
but so far we have not seen any action from them.
Billboards are a sensitive topic for many politicians on national, regional and local level, and they are often torn over the issue.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower compared to last year.
In contrast, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy is expected to increase by 3.9 and 2.5 percent, respectively.
Last year's harvest of cereals was above average.
This year, planted areas decreased by three percent.
This is attributable to a 15.2 percent reduction in planted areas and a lower per hectare yield.
The rye harvest is also expected to be higher year-on-year.
However, the yield per hectare will be about 3.2 percent lower than last year.
The area planted with poppy seed has also increased over the past four years
Thanks to the increase in sown areas, this year's poppy harvest is expected to be a success.
It will increase compared to last year by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons.
The yield per hectare will be about 6.1 percent lower.
The police arrested two men, who on Tuesday attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
"Although the victim tried to escape, he suffered stabbing and cutting wounds which required hospital treatment and further rehabilitation," said the police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková.
The perpetrators were arrested by the police immediately after the attack.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, said Marie Štrbáková, the spokeswoman of Olomouc police.
Following an aggressive altercation, two men attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
The skirmish, which attracted a lot of attention in the city centre as several police units had to intervene at the scene, was the result of a family dispute.
Detectives arrested a thirty four-year-old man from Slovakia and a thirty-seven-year-old man from Olomouc on suspicion of attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
Two of the foreign attackers received a suspended sentence.

Polio makes a return in Nigeria.
Polio cases have resurfaced in Nigeria.
The vaccines were delivered by helicopters.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, the government is planning to launch an emergency polio vaccination campaign in response of two infected children having been paralysed.
The Nigerian government planning on immunizing one million children in the state of Borno and another four million in the neighbouring states.
AP reported that Nigerian military helicopters delivered the polio vaccines quickly to the north-eastern part of the country, where the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram operates.
The Director of polio eradication at WHO told BBC that the immunisation in Nigeria will start as early as next week.
The radical Islamic group Boko Haram operated in the state of Borno for a long time.
The vaccination programme is for children under five years of age.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all new polio cases in the world.

France plans tough action against breeding grounds for jihadists.
The Muslim community is expected to assist the French government in the fight against radical Islamism.
The government of the Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing fundamental changes with respect to mosques and the education of clergy.
and other will follow, said the interior minister.
The country has over one hundred breeding grounds for jihadists.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams trained in France are allowed to practice in mosques and other places of worship.
At the same time he wants to stop the funding of mosques from abroad.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he added.
The key to ensuring these objectives are met should be the new French Islamic foundation,
No more money from abroad.
The institution was soon hit by internal divisions and rivalries.
"It is a total failure," said Valls recently.
In the aftermath of the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate over a new institution that would replace the largely defunct foundation ignited the French political scene.
This urgency has been augmented by further terrorist attacks in France carried out by radicalised Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.

Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
He's denied that emphatically.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.

As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.

Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017

On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
"Fortunately, by the time we had launched, the strong winds had blown it clear of them," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket.
They were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Judge refuses to deal with the case because of Tluchoř's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who have been accused by the prosecution service of taking bribes in the form of lucrative positions from the then Prime Minister Nečas and his former chief of staff Jana Nagyova in return for a political concession.
Following the intervention of the Supreme Court, Tluchoř is now acting as a witness in the case.
His wife works in the courthouse at Ovocný trh, where she handles civil disputes.
This is despite the fact that Ms Králová has twice acquitted Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová
Tluchoř was not involved in this case.
According to the lawyer, Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary knee-jerk reaction.
I think that the principle of impartiality should not be interpreted in a way that would exclude a court if a witness's spouse or relative works at the courthouse.
According to his lawyer, Petr Toman, a potential objection may have a chance to succeed.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 discussed the indictment of the former chief of staff of the Prime Minister Petr Nečas, Jana Nagyová (today Nečasová) and the other accused in the case of misuse of military intelligence.
Ms Nečasová is pictured arriving at the court with her husband.
Ms Tluchořová was meant to judge statements about Peroutka.
The wife of the former MP was, for example, scheduled to judge a case involving the statements of the Czech President, Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said about him that he was a Hitler sympathiser.

A dream job for six figure salary.
A well-paid job without a university degree.
This is the job of an IT specialist at first sight
and often the second.
The advantage is not only the extremely high salary by Czech standards (in Prague, IT specialists can make up to CZK 180,000), but also very attractive benefits.
The reason is the enormous shortage of IT specialists.
Candidates can choose from several job offers.
The demand is considerably higher than the supply and employers compete for candidates, said Jitka Součková, the marketing manager of Grafton Recruitment.
University is not a must.
Higher education is a good foundation and overall indicator of intelligence and education of the candidate, but it does not tend to have much in common with the knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which cannot be substituted by just completing a university, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
IT professional salaries are everywhere well above the national average.
The salary levels in Brno are comparable with those in Prague," says Kubačka.
In other regions, the salaries are lower, but they still do not drop below CZK 80 000.
While some graduates have no choice but to go straight to the employment office, this does not apply to IT specialists.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
Czech employees can only envy Google staff.
The benefits do not stop there.
A well-stocked fridge for free is also quite something.
Healthy lunches (in some localities also breakfasts and dinners) are available at the workplace every day.
In addition, all offices feature so-called micro-kitchens, which are always well stocked with healthy snacks, revealed the spokeswoman.
And the reason for these benefits unheard of by Czech standards?
UN has sharply criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Mr Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's lack of respect for international law," warned Mr Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
What is worse - they are often prosecuted and jailed - for a year or longer - if they attempt to leave the country.
This year, Bulgaria arrested 14,000 migrants, last year over the same period, it was 21,000.
Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).
Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.
Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people are even making new friends on the hunt.
So what?
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.

Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
It's not a coincidence.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about while pregnant.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
He's walking with help, and riding a bike.
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I actually haven't asked for a prognosis in forever, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.
Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.
Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.
In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.

Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.

Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.
The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth.
From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives
He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.
One-half of the funeral services is not complying with regulations.
This is the result of checks carried out by the Czech Trade Inspectorate (CTI) in the second quarter,
including mainly urn containers, covers for candles and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
Before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement derives from actual data.
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
He has, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.
From conversations I've had, people have got rid of their collection, normally around 1998 or 1999.
It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.
More of the product side, less of the music.
Fopp, which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl, has a far more varied audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
She doesn't earn a lot, she says, so collecting records isn't really an option.
It costs a lot.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
Ulč resurrected himself and volleyball in Ústí.
What was wrong with you?
I had a blood clot in my calf for two years, and I had no idea.
Then the clot moved upwards.
This does not present a limitation for me in any way - it is rather an aesthetic thing.
I was.
Last year at a summer tournament in Dřevěnice, I could not move at all, and I had no idea that I had a blood clot.
In the evening, I vomited blood.
In Dřevěnice, I really thought I was going to die. My girlfriend and my family also thought so.
I already started picturing myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
Just when I was ready to return to preparation in Příbram last year, I started having problems with my heart.
Everything is fine now.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I am excited - the team looks strong, and I know most of the guys.
I hope we will get on on a personal level, and we can work well together.
Do you think you will be able to provide Ústí with a much needed boost?
Two years ago, Brno was eighth, and now it finished second.
Ústí has a completely new team, only a few players remain.
What we make of it is up to us.
He is very experienced and he has seen a lot, and he certainly wants to lift the team from the last place.
However, my arrival had nothing to do with his; I agreed to join earlier.
There were other managers in the running, I am great friends with one of them and there was an agreement that he will join here.
I do not want to mention the name.
In the end, they hired Mr Brom and I am happy about the decision.
He will move us up in the rankings.
I played for Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a much bigger challenge than to play for the sixth team because here we have to start from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, the Australian player Boehm is already training with Ústí.
What does he look like?
As it happens, I know him because we played against each other in the group at the Universiade.
We beat them 3:1, I reminded him right at the beginning of summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he is a nice guy.
You got in touch with the American?
I am a setter, which means my role is to create opportunities, so I should be communicating with everyone.
We exchanged a couple of messages on Facebook, he is a bit of a comedian, I think he will fit in well with the team.
How are you looking forward to being the number one setter?
After all, I will be twenty-four soon and I don't like being a substitute.
I prefer to be at the centre of things, leading the team rather than let somebody else lead.
Six months in Příbram, when Kust, the captain was not in form, got injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
In Brno, where I started, I alternated between first and second setter.
I had a great year at Staré Město, and I could choose from a range of offers and I decided to go for Příbram.
While there, Budějovice has shown interest in me, I decided to stay, but I could not finish the season because of the embolism episode.
I am experiencing an incredible week at the end of my career.
Following in the footsteps of Alu Oerter (discus throw) and Carl Lewis (long jump), Michael Phelps becomes the third athlete in Olympic history to win four consecutive individual titles in the same event.
Brazil's Thiago Pereira and his compatriot, Ryan Lochte kept pace with Lochte for most of the race,
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his historic medal collection.
Shortly after the medal presentation ceremony for the individual medley he advanced into the 100m butterfly final.
While Murphy only finished fifth in 200m backstroke at last year's World Championships, he became the undisputed backstroke king at the Rio Olympics.
He unseated Mitch Larkin from the throne, who won a similar double at last year's World Championship.
American Simone Manuel and Canada's Penny Oleksiak claimed joint gold in the women's 100m freestyle final.
While for the sixteen-year-old Penny Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Simon Manuel, it was the second medal after having earned silver in the relay.
Manuel became the first black female swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal.
The world record holder, Australia's Cate Cambell only finished sixth.
This was the second silver medal for Russia's Yulia Efimova, who faced hostility from her fellow competitors and the crowd because of her doping past.
I won my appeal and I do not see why I have to keep answering these questions all the time.
She had to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to compete at the Rio games.
They have considered my appeal, and I have won.
It was a strange day for the Czechs.
They only found out less than an hour before the match who they will be playing against.
They had to master the tactical preparation at a lighting speed.
And then, in an unusual time, the match started on the small court number 1.
After a dismal start to the first set, they closed on their opponents only to fail to bring the set home at 19:19.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermannová said.
We lost that set, which was crucial.
We started the next set well with a changed defence strategy, we served well and dominated the court.
We were able to close on, but we lost the crucial points.
We made too many mistakes.
How did you like playing on the small court number 1?
It was strange.
Do you recall ever having to start a match at midnight?
I don't think so.
We played at half past ten, but not at midnight.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková a Barbora Hermannová embrace during the preliminary round play-off at the Olympic Games in Rio.
This was still about two hours later.
How do you rate your Olympic experience?
I'll sleep on it and from tomorrow, I will only remember the positive aspects of the Olympic tournament.
The Thai national telecoms regulator presented the plan to sell SIM cards specifically designed for foreigners in early August.
In addition, these so-called tourist SIM cards should also help to uncover individuals who exceed their length of stay without proper authorisation.
The principal difference between them is in the tracking function which will be permanently enabled on SIM cards sold exclusively to individuals without a Thai passport.
It will not be possible to disable this function.
"We do not need this feature for SIM cards sold to Thais because we can always easily track them," added Tantasith.
The seller requires a proof of identity.
Other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also mulling to follow the Thai example and introduce similar measures.
This is because the operators in the destination country only know the relevant network information. Once a SIM connects to the network,
The authorities' efforts to track the movements of foreigners, have been the subject of sharp criticism by expat groups living in Thailand.
Police will need to get a court order if they wanted to track the movements of a concrete individual.
Any abuse of the system will lead to a yet unspecified punishment.
Luxury flat in a new development in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you opt for a flat in a new development?
The entire interior was designed by the architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Polaková from the interior design studio Artigo.
We have already worked with Lenka Langerová on our flat in the mountains based on a recommendation from another client and because everything worked well we decided to approach her to work on the reconstruction of our new flat in Vinohrady.
We wanted a generous entertaining-living space with adequate facilities for a family of four, conceived as a modern yet not impersonal interior.
Not least it was also important to safeguard the quality of execution.
Did you leave everything to the experts or did you have a say in the final look of the interior?
We approved all designs including technical drawings but the designs were always created by the architects.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech paintings, including the works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund helped the architects to get a feel for our taste.
This forced us to change the layout plans literally overnight.
How would you characterise the interior?
Are you planning any changes or is there something you wish you would have done differently?
Comments by the architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, who implemented the project
The flat is on the top floor of a new development, which made it possible to come up with a completely new layout and several other modifications.
You are not as negative as the French, says a Muslim living in Prague.
So I moved around quite a bit.
I started to feel suffocated in France.
I just did not want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
People in France are generally quite negative, but it has become much worse lately.
Believe me, you are not as negative as the French.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbour started to look down on me just because I am a Muslim.
As if I was some kind of evil.
As a result, I no longer felt welcome in France,
even though the rest of my family stayed there.
I admit that I did not know anything about Prague at the beginning.
I have now been living here for three years, and I cannot imagine living anywhere else.
Mainly because of the different atmosphere.
Maybe it is because I do not speak Czech, so I cannot catch some of the negative reactions or insults, but I feel that people have more freedom here.
I feel I can do anything, dress in any way I like, and nobody will judge me.
In France, people keep starring at you in an unpleasant way because you dress differently, etc.
In Prague, I began to feel really free.
After I left Air France, I worked for a while for a travel website.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I must say that Czechs tend to keep their distance at first.
They do not let just anyone get too close,
In the south, everybody is hugging and kissing each other on the cheek.
Does the language barrier present a problem for you?
Quite the contrary, I find it is really easy here in Prague because virtually everyone speaks English here.
Even in convenience stores and supermarkets.
and because it is relatively easy to communicate in English, I do not have the incentive to learn the language quickly.
I can think of one experience though.
A colleague once warned me, however, about anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me to avoid the city centre because they would only be hurling insults at me.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
What do you think about the current situation?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen here in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
And this does not only concern Muslims.
What do you think about terrorists using your faith to justify their actions?
I feel shame and guilt, even though I should not feel like that at all.
I try not to follow the news about violence too much but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologise for something that is really not my fault.
We met on náměstí Jiřího z Poděbrad.
No, I was not aware of it.
But I understand why people feel the need to show that they are against violence.
I do not think that they have to do something like this.
Do you come across other Muslims in Prague?
What do you think about it?
I definitely do not feel subordinate.
Quite the contrary.
and wear a hijab for example?
It has something to do with how I was raised.
It depends on how one interprets it.
When you read the Quran, you should make up your own mind.
So far, yes.
I could even imagine raising my children here.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians demonstrated against violence.
The Czech sailor, Veronika Kozelská-Fenclová did well in Friday's two heats on the race course in Rio di Janiero.
In the Laser Radial Class, she moved to the tenth place before the final two heats.
This would guarantee the Czech yachtswoman a place in the final.
You can collect parcels like Pokémon.
The brains behind the idea to use already scheduled journeys to transport packages are the TV director Matěj Liška and Marek Greger, a manager of a music club in Prague.
How does the app "Převezu" work and who can benefit from it?
You can download the app for free and register.
If both sides agree on the route and the time of delivery, the app matches them together and they both receive a notification,
Next a chat window opens, where the two sides can arrange the handover/pick up.
How many people do you think will have to register to match every package with a courier?
Have you not dealt with such a case yet?
How many users does the service have two months after launch?
We consider this to be a success and believe that it will snowball from here.
Is there not a risk that the sender may have to wait too long?
Large companies charge several thousand Czech crowns for delivery within two hours.
With us, you pay one hundred Czech crowns or less because someone is going to your destination anyway.
We hope that this will be the case.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška is a TV director.
In 2015, they hired a company to work on the project, which created apps, e.g. for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
It took 9 months to develop the app, and they launched to the market in March 2016.
It is the same thing, just a different product.
What does make you believe that this service has such a big potential?
The sender will save money and the courier will lower the cost of his journey.
Maybe someone will bring you your misplaced glasses, keys or medication.
How can you guarantee that the courier will not take the parcel and run away?
We will also be offering insurance, the details of which are currently being fine-tuned.
The sender will be charged a few percentage points extra for arranging the contact between the two sides.
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes - the smallest is about butter size, the medium is like a tray of eggs and the large is the size of a crate of beer.
The sender also has the option to take a picture of the parcel through the app, so that the courier can see what the job in hand is.
All you have to do is hand the forgotten sweatshirt to the courier.
A friend came up with the idea more than two years ago, and I did not pay much attention to it back then.
We spent the next year developing the app, so we decided to establish Shippansee LTD in London to enhance the credibility of the whole product.
Nevertheless, this is not an area you are now focusing on as a matter of priority.
We want to respond to the feedback from our customers, and we are not that focused on foreign markets at present.
Does this mean that people can literally pick up parcels around the town as their second job?
The courier can see where there are jobs available, he or she can click on it and find out when the package is due for delivery, and then goes ahead and delivers the package.
We will then be in the position to invoice them, e.g. every month for using the service.
Do you now devote all your time to the project?
We do not have a multinational investor with deep pockets backing us. We are two regular guys - one who had a great idea and another who jumped on the bandwagon with additional suggestions and ideas.
The story-scope of Titanfall 2 is expected to deliver nearly forgotten diversity.
Players can enjoy the freedom of movement, which next to running includes the option to use a fighting Titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game contains levels focused on flexibility in movement.
They are reminiscent of platform games and puzzles.
In addition, players will have to do damage to their enemies.
There will also be maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one of them, it will be, for example, possible to move platforms up and down and open massive doors,
Players will be in control of a foot soldier Jack Cooper, who is dreaming about becoming a professional pilot.
What is more, Lastimosa is fatally wounded in the crash and Cooper, therefore, has to revive the captain's Titan.
The first step will be to steal the battery necessary to repair the robot.
These will serve as a source of information for the players to find out about the soldier's past, while at the same time, the impersonal communication style of the robot will produce some laughs.
For example, when the Titan dryly lists all the injuries that Cooper could suffer as a result of a planned jump.
The Polygon server was first to report on the Titanfall 2 campaign.
THQ brand will be resurrected but the original publishing house is dead.
The Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to Nordic THQ.
Following the collapse of the publishing house THQ, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the company name and logo.
There are another 23 games being created for the publishing house, which is yet to reveal 13 of them.
He was quite a big guy, probably her type as she dated a similar type before me.
She was head over heels in love with him.
In those first days, her voice even changed; she suddenly had such a girly, infatuated voice.
He used to arrive at home from work at half past three and she always left at three to go shopping.
She tried to see him at least once every day.
I was incapable of taking the decisive step and going there.
And I actually did it.
At the same time, my other neighbours also hinted that they knew about the affair.
I still hoped that it would end one day.
and I have never really come to terms with it.
She always did everything at home - she did the cooking, washing, cleaning up.
She has always been a hard worker.
I think she wanted to make sure that I do not have another reason to complain.
I can also say that she is kind.
I can see that she still loves him, she worships him like a god.
I am tired of such a life.
I wanted to know whether she would agree with it.
It was, however, soon hit by internal divisions, and it never worked properly.
"It is a total failure," said Valls recently.
This week, the German police also took action against radical clerics,
who were allegedly recruiting fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them would be a special charge on halal food, i.e. mainly meat from animals slaughtered according to Islamic principles.
This charge would, in practice, be paid by the vendors of halal food for certification.
Every year, around 30,000 French Muslims go on this pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers trained at local universities should be permitted to practice in mosques.
"We have shut down twenty mosques since December and other will follow," said the Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
On Friday morning, an unnamed gunman seriously injured his ex-wife in a shopping centre in Zaragoza in Northern Spain, the newspaper Independent reported.
The woman was taken to the hospital by her uninjured daughter, while the man in critical condition was taken there by ambulance.
While summer is the time to enjoy light, easily digestible meals, we Czechs are rebels, and we are quite stubborn when it comes to our tastes.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, except perhaps for a salad or roasted vegetables here and there.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a bit of skill will make the preparation enjoyable and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
Banana leaves also lend food a specific flavour.
This is available frozen.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will be familiar with nori seaweed.
Dried and shredded wakame is also used as a spice for seasoning rice, for example.
Next, they cool it in ice water, cut out the centre ribbing and processed further to prepare e.g. this popular salad.
All that remains is to prepare a roll with a simple vegetable filling, which is both delicious and light and full of healthy flavours.
You have to resist adding a grilled pork belly.
Healthy & light summer dishes
It is finished in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots 40 g white radish, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g cucumber 60 g wakame seaweed and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
Soak the rice paper for five seconds in the cold water.
In the meantime, cook the asparagus tips briefly in hot water and cool them in cold water after roughly three minutes.
We place the vegetable filling on the softened paper and wrap it.
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
Here, they lost just one.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
It was an incentive.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.

You had to face several unpleasant skirmishes with those you have exposed.
I am mainly curious about the verdict,
That is useless.
by having to drive people for free.
This is a somewhat strange solution.
Does it mean that you do not consider the likely punishment handed down by the court to be sufficiently effective?
Do you think this is an adequate tariff?
They have been destroying our country's reputation by brazenly stealing from people for twenty-five years.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříček in Písek and subsequently, at Tomáš Baťa University in Zlín.
This is a series of short reports, in which Rubeš advises foreign visitors which services they should be using and what they should avoid.
In the indictment, they are referred to as an organised group.
The police followed them for several months.
This is more about mobsters-juniors, but they are definitely organised.
I have observed, for example, that those at the main railway station do not like those in Pařížská, and those in Pařížská, in turn, do not have cordial relations with drivers at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
It is probably a complex network,
As you have said, this undesirable element has not disappeared from the streets.
What percentage of Prague taxi drivers do you consider to be fraudulent?
the worst of them are still roaming the streets.
I am talking about Aleš Ryjáček, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries an expandable baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday, he is at the taxi rank near Charles Bridge and drives people around the city.
The police has not detained him for some reason.
They only picked a few people from that large group.
The indictment of seven people will hardly eradicate a well-known Prague vice, which appears to be much bigger.
On the other hand, I would not say that this was a completely futile exercise.
It will help, but it will not eradicate all the evil.
Do the taxi drivers who prey on foreign tourists still frequent the same locations which you have showed in your reports, i.e. near the Charles Bridge or Pařížská?
This is being ignored by the Metropolitan Police and the Prague Magistrate.
The business of the Prague taxi drivers in numbers
This is a breakthrough.
I have to ask you whether you now feel vindicated?
You cannot be happy with that.
In reality, however, there are many more out there.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in their taxis?
He charged me 560 Czech crowns for three kilometres, and claimed the amount was 56 crowns (he used the trick with the decimal point).
A similar case.
Is it safe to say that these fraudsters have not stopped their activities even after you have shown the faces of those who charged ridiculous amounts for a short ride?
When I filmed the series about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves told me about this precedent.
You spoke about the trick with the decimal point, which the fraudsters use to scam foreign customers.
Is this still happening or are they worried to use this trick after you have reported on it?
I think that by broadcasting the report we have made this trick even more popular.
Is there something at all that could deter them from scamming people?
You said that you believed that they would always find a way how to cheat.
However, they could be pushed out from the taxi ranks,
It is my experience that the fair taxi drivers are thankfully in the majority.
When they staged the demonstration (because of blanket restrictions proposed by the office of the Mayor of Prague Adriana Krnáčová), they did not come across as if they knew exactly what they wanted.
It is obvious, that the criminal police had to get involved to handle the matter.
The Magistrate did not have clout to deal with the problem.
They had a mole there who was passing on information, which means that their taxi department's efforts were futile for several years.
I hope that they will ask the official to pay for all the checks that came to nothing because of his activities, so that he realises what he has done.
It has been several months since you have released the final episodes of your show.
I mainly heard from foreign viewers, who were our primary focus.
Whenever my friends are over from abroad, I play them the videos.
I would build a fence around them like in a museum.
Museum of communism right here on the street.
Do you take a taxi when you need it?
There are also many taxi companies which are fair.
I have only hailed a cab on a street once since then.
Once I got into the taxi, the driver said:
Bém disguised as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were an issue already back in 2005.
The journalist Rubeš had a worse experience.
The footage also reveals other surprising amounts being charged: for example a two kilometre ride from Pařížská to Truhlářská tourist costing a tourist 400 crowns.
Marble is mainly cleaned with clean water, avoiding chemicals as much as possible and the longer the better.
It is fairly easy to clean even though from time to time you need a scalpel to remove the dirt from the creases.
It is not easy and it is not fast, said the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov v Hájích.
What she does is very impressive: the tomb is enclosed in scaffolding, which she has to keep climbing up and down.
"A restorer has to be diligent, patient and not too demanding with respect to the working conditions," she said.
This is by far not her first restoration work in the Frýdlant region.
She was behind the restoration of the stone elements of the façade in the rear wing of the Frýdlant Town Hall, the statue of St. Mary Magdalene in , Zátiší, the statue of St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Pieta in Okružní ulice in Frýdlant, Marian Column in Frýdlant or Atlanta in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration work on the gravestone of Melchior of Redern, his wife Catherine and their son Christoph began already in 2011.
We are currently removing deposits of dirt and crusts from the surface of the stone elements, and securing loose stone parts against falling and movement; they may be anchored to the wall or to one another.
We are also going to treat and preserve the surface.
"Next, the inscriptions on marble slabs will be gilded with pure gold leaf," said Věra Sobotová, the national heritage official from the Frýdlant Magistrate.
A closer look has revealed interesting holes, drilled into the marble columns.
There are hundreds of years old, and they are remnants of the gravestone decoration.
It was richly decorated, but unfortunately after the raid by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, it all disappeared.
They literally stripped it bare, said Ms Sobotová.
The restorers feel quite at home in the Church of the Holy Cross.
The restoration work on the Redern family tomb will cost in total 128 thousand Czech crowns.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from the regional round of the competition "Historic city of 2015", the balance of 28 thousand crowns will be contributed by the Ministry of Culture, said the Mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
It was the decision of the Municipal Council to release the winnings to restore the tomb.
Markets are characterised by growth and low volatility.
Hardly anyone predicted it at the beginning of the year.
In a situation where US stocks are trading at their all-time highs, volatility is again decreasing. Volatility is currently at its lowest since 2014, when markets were growing thanks to the quantitative easing programme of the Federal Reserve and the volatility index (VIX) held steady below 12 percent.
How long will this party last?
This is, of course, the million dollar question.
There are currently no risks in sight, the world economy is going through a period of almost constant growth without any major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity markets and in China is stabilising and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we should not be surprised if US shares continued in this relatively calm mode going forward.
Juncker's choice was a blow to any hope that it would be in the interest of the EU to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with the UK.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) he was in charge of reforming the European banking law.
Michel Barnier, who will be representing Paris in a dispute with London, is likely to be a tough, relentless and ruthless negotiator.
This probably is not good news.
It is a pity that Juncker has not taken a leaf from Vaclav Klaus's book in this regard.
It would be to the greater benefit of all of us!
The Kremlin leader dismissed his close ally and confidant Ivanov.
This was reported by the Russian media, citing a press release put out by Kremlin's press office.
Putin signalled that he has relieved Ivanov from his duties at his own request.
At the same time, he announced that Mr Ivanov had been appointed Special Presidential Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport.
The news of the replacement at the top of the president's office has come as a surprise. Ivanov will be replaced by his former deputy, Vajno.
Ivanov, who is 63, is considered to be one of Putin's closest allies.
Now he is also vacating the post of the chair of the president's security council.
During the meeting with Putin, Ivanov said that he was a record holder in terms of holding the position of chief of staff.
Neither Kvitová nor the double act of Strýcová and Šafářová will be playing in the finals.
Kvitová was shortly followed by the Czech double players Strýcová and Šafářová.
The pair, who defeated the Williams sisters, was close to winning the first set, but then missed two set balls and the Russians eventually won the set in a tiebreaker.
Czech rowing recorded some success during the morning programme in Rio: Ondřej Synek won his semifinal in single sculls by beating Chroatia's Damir Martin almost by a second despite easing a bit at the end of the race.
I tried to conserve my power as much as possible, Synek said.
so this may make things easier tomorrow.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not follow in Synek's footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old rower came in fourth in her semifinal and on Saturday, she will start in the B finals, where she will fight for seventh to twelfth place.
She will not be able to defend her gold from London.
Simply put, the competition was better, said Topinková Knapková.
She fought until the end believing that she will reach the elite six in her fourth consecutive games.
I was surprised by the Chinese rower and her strong finish.
I thought that I would be able to beat the Austrian to progress to the final.
The young shooter Filip Nepejchal was far outside the finals as he failed to qualify for the second time, this time in small-bore rifle prone
event in which he finished 33rd.
The Russian team performed best in the qualification.
The first track and field athletes have started their campaigns, among them the Czech heptathletes Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
After the second discipline, Cachová is currently in the eleventh place, and the Czech record holder, Eliška Klučinová in the twenty-second.
the German society has gone through a period of profound self-reflection, but the Russian society did not.
The Nazis wiped out in an inhuman way about 6 million Jews and in total the total number of victims of the Second World War is estimated at 60 million.
Both Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities in the occupied or abandoned territories.
The most important thing, however, came later.
How could you!
It brought real reflection and healing to the society.
Criminal past is often celebrated in Russia
The main policy of Putin's Russia is revenge, conquest of the lost territories and the humiliation of the West.
Beat your own and others will be afraid.
I still believe that this only the product of decades of despotic regimes, that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior-destined to Asian-style (self) tyranny.
The Ukrainian army.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of even tougher sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
Ukraine's economy would have gone bankrupt a long ago if it were not for the generous funding from the EU and the IMF.
Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months

According to the Reuters agency, the material on monitoring the Russian hacks was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, known as the Gang of Eight in the US was briefed.
The chain apologised.
Based on the health complaint from a consumer after eating the Wild Smoked Salmon- pieces 100 g, with the use-by date of 22.11.2016, the Prague hygienists carried out inspections of the Albert stores at Václavské náměstí and Na Můstku.
This worm is dangerous to humans as the larvae ingested can invade the internal organs through the stomach wall, said Šticha.
Any customers who have purchased the product, can return it to any of our stores for a full refund.
The seller was Nekton-Vrňata.
According to the server bezpecnostpotravin.cz, people can suffer from anisakiasis as a result of ingesting the parasite. The symptoms include stomach pains, vomiting and nausea, but some patients do not have any symptoms at all, said ČTK.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high or low temperatures, and are therefore killed either during heat processing or freezing.
The veterinary service has inspected the salmon at the premises of the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Bohemia.
Three of the five examined samples tested positive for the parasite.
According to the State Veterinary Service (SVS), the shipment containing 1700 products came to the Czech Republic at the beginning of April.
It was mainly delivered to the Ahold chain of supermarkets, which received 919 packs to date.
We are currently in the process of withdrawing all unsold stocks from the stores, said the spokesman of SVS Petr Pejchal to ČTK on Friday.
Seventeen-year-old British teenager wanted to flee from Raqqa, and is reported to have been killed by a Russian air strike.
After the initial excitement and quick marriage to a jihadist, who was soon killed, came the sobering.
The girl was, according to relatives, in touch with her sister Halima.
She called her repeatedly in the UK and confided to her that he wanted to come home.
They have orders to shoot indiscriminately, the Daily Telegraph quoted the lawyer of the family of the dead girl, Tasnime Akunjee.
The family communicated with her from their flat in East London.
The UK TV broadcaster added that the bomb was probably dropped by a Russian aircraft attacking the IS stronghold in Syria.
Kadiza Sutlana left for Syria together with her friends Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, who were both just 15 at the time, on 17 February last year.
Instead, they went to Gatwick Airport, from where they flew to Turkey, and then they crossed to the IS-held territory.
According to the family lawyer, the family did everything in their power to get Kadiza back.
The fate of Kadiza's classmates is not known.

The town representatives, therefore, decided to move the prison to a new location.
It did not stay open for long and it finally closed by the end of August 1889 for economic reasons, as by this time, the smaller county jails were expensive and inefficient to run.
Prisoner stories and ghost hunting
Such a night will set you back at least 300 pounds, which is roughly 9,500 Czech crowns.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning "diving board."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
They are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have convulsed the country, spreading into more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip.
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.
But that may be changing.
A generation is protesting.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle along that jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
But that is changing as well.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean.
After making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him.
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Naturally, it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront.
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
The coffee is still good, too.
It even reused the lights from the old Verb.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.
The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently.
After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.
Now she's back on coffee, although that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.
He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.
"Quarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said.
These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he'll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
This is how TV shows would look like if we were making them.
A group of Russian artists, who call themselves 2D Among Us, is poking fun at mother Russia.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.

Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.
But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.
Desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
A tolerant city.
the Executive Director of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková said on Friday.
"Thanks to the widespread tolerance and a range of specialised venues, Prague is among the most popular destinations for the LGBT community," said Petříčková.
According to a survey conducted by the organisers, the event's foreign visitors spend on average 3,100 Czech crowns per person per day.
"As tourists, the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, because they enjoy luxury travel and high standard of travel services and they spend far more than anyone else", said Ms Petříčková.
We are also holding the first Pride Tourism Symposium as part of the festival.
It serves as a platform for presentations by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday 14 August.
The highlight of the festival will be the traditional parade featuring floats, from Václavské náměstí to Letná.
Pat and Mat turn forty this year.
The die-hard handymen Pat & Mat, who are synonymous with DIY gone wrong, have been entertaining children and adults for forty years.
Lubomír Beneš then invited the dramaturg Jiri Kubicek and fellow artist Vladimír Jiránek to work with him and together they created the short film entitled Kuťáci (The Tinkers).
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated films AIF in Prague and Zurich where he created further episodes.
A fairy tale for Fiji and the two-year-old Harmony.
So let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
What do people spend most of their money on at airports?
This is a Friday overview from the world's websites.
The island state of Fiji is celebrating a historical success.
Fiji's rugby team defeated in the final of the Olympic sevens rugby tournament the team of Great Britain.
This is the first Olympic gold medal ever won by Fiji.
It took them sixty years from sending their first delegations to the Olympic Games.
He has been managing the team since 2013 and after the final, he had a reason to celebrate in contrast to his compatriots.
Fiji eventually dominated the match, and the small island state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale,
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who lost all her limbs when she was 11 months old has a new friend.
"She loves to take the arms and the legs off and they love to sit next to each other without the prosthetics on."
I love everything about her.
She is quite upfront, too.
I have seen her introduce herself to another child by saying, "I'm Harmonie and I have no hands".
See how happy the little girl is about her new friend.
On what do we spend most money at airports?
According to CNN, people spend most money at airports for bottled water.
The ninth place is occupied by M&M Peanut king-size with coconut flavour.
According to CNN it is "The Wall Street Journal."
We are just going to win, Murray and Bond said laughing.
In Thursday's finale they have recorded their 69th win in a row on the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon.
What do we do differently from other crews?
We train hard, really hard,
While Murray is almost two meters tall and weighs 100 kilos, Bond is five centimetres shorter and 15 kilos lighter.
Moreover, they have completely different personalities -
Bond is studying finance, and Murray has been involved i.a. in a charity boxing match.
This is likely the reason why they do not spend much time together outside rowing.
Eric gets in the boat with the attitude that we cannot lose.
We are just going to win.
I have a tendency to think about what might go wrong, Bond admitted who clearly demonstrated during the press conference that Murray had the more dominant personality of the two.
On the water, they are destroying their competition with their quiet strength.
We know what we have to do to win, said the thirty-four-year-old Murray.
Together with his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were part of the men's four without coxswain.
This time it was more enjoyable.
We walk around with the target on our backs.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not register, there would not be a qualification agreement. Does this mean that I could move to a different hospital after a few months?
Is it even possible to work after completing the course without having to register with a specialised training programme?
I am asking because there is an opening in the field I would like to work in. The only problem is that the hospital is far away. There may be another opening in six months in a hospital much closer to me where I would like to work.
The question is answered by Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
The law foresees a situation where professional experience in another field of specialisation can count towards specialised medical training of the doctor in question, if its content and scope relate to the relevant educational programme.
Russian forces which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, announced that from today, military hostilities in Aleppo will stop for three hours every day to allow humanitarian convoys safe passage.
All military activity, including air strikes and artillery fire is supposed to stop from 9:00 to 12:00 CEST.
Gasping for air, their lives ended before they had really begun.
The rebels, who are under constant attack by Russian and Syrian air force, managed to break through the siege on Saturday and launch a counteroffensive.
Both sides have added reinforcements both in the city and the surrounding areas.
