A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
He's denied that emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson sacked after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
The show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
"Fortunately, by the time we had launched, the strong winds had blown it clear of them," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket.
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.
Someone was watching over these guys today.
Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.
Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.
A generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.
So what?
The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.
However because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.
"It's occurring within a residential area in front of a home," Howard said to CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.
"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected over the state through Saturday.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.
Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.
It came up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.
"They will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.
In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.
All the way along his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health.
From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.
He said in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.'
There's nothing more dirty than that!
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.
Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.
Dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Eksote’s result during the first half of the year better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a result that was 3,4 million euros better than planned between January and June.
Eksote’s result showed a surplus of 4,3 million euros during the first half of the year.
The result was especially good in the family and social welfare services, where, by developing preventive services, it has been possible to clear institutional care.
The statutory care guarantee was fulfilled in all operations.

In addition, the unit has a civilian specialising in information technology working in Hämeenlinna.
The unit has proved its usability and necessity, considers Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
In Häme it has, among other things, gathered information about asylum seekers.
The most recent method reform
Establishing the analysis units has been the most recent reform of the Police methods.
The PCB Centre in Vantaa operates in contact with the National Bureau of Investigation and manages the operations on a national level.
Where a single police officer knows, what has happened during their 12-hour work shift, the task of an RTA unit is to know, what is going on in the whole are of a police department.
Those working in an RTA unit have better IT skills than a rank and file police officer.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of operating.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The analysis unit has observed that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform that finished by the end of year 2013.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
I do this for women.
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement derives from actual data.
According to YouGov, the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item, but by midlife nostalgia.
So, let's take a look.
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.
"I suppose I am," he says.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint.
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says.
He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
From conversations I've had, people have got rid of their collection, normally around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?
It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular.
Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve, of items that recall halcyon teenage memories.
It's an easy way to occupy your headspace.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.
"Someone came in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says.
That's not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.
We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
She is window-shopping, rather than on a spending spree.
I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classics, the essential records for any average collection.
Nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration, some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
The price of food in Finland has dropped nearly 5 per cent in three years, when the average price drop in EU countries was 0.9 per cent.
At the same time food in Germany and Sweden is one per cent more expensive.
During the last three years, the price of food in Finland has dropped the second most in those EU countries that have the same wage level than Finland.
Lehtinen compared real prices, prices that are in proportion to the general development of the consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the beginning of the 2010s, the price of the food rose sharply.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing that price advantage we got from EU membership”, Lehtinen says.
Then a change followed, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
That is why the supply of dairy and meat products has increased in the Finnish market, and the producer prices have dropped.
“Putin’s policies have helped the Finnish consumer in the short term”, says Lehtinen.
The large chains, S Group and Kesko, have both reduced their prices.
According to Lehtinen, the food prices in Finland are considerably affected by the value-added tax.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he did with the value-added tax percentage are approximate.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the curriculum states the official goals.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of the pupils.
It can live 250 years after that, a new study reported.
These numbers make this species to be the longest lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom there is only one who passes it: the oldest ocean quahog known has been estimated to be 507 years old.
The females are taller than the males, as they can grow to be over five metres tall.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen together with his colleagues found out.
The age of the fish was revealed in radiocarbon dating their eye lenses.
The two largest fish in the sample, the amazon-sized fish of 493 and 502 centimetres long, were revealed to 335 and 392 years old respectively.
The study was published by Science.
On the background are Stockmann’s difficulties to make department store sales profitable.
Even though the group’s adjusted operating result improved to 11.1 million euros in the second quarter of the year, the department store sales are still unprofitable.
The improved second-quarter result is particularly a consequence of the solid performance of fashion chain Lindex.
At the same time last year, the operating result of the whole Stockmann Group had a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover this year will be smaller than last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
The low-pressure area on top of northern Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Lång.
There will be rain showers also in the central parts of the country, but the weather will be fair farther south.
The temperatures are not very summery anymore, because the mercury will stay below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The rainy areas in the north will remain in 10-15 degrees.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he “committed his crime against team Kenya”.
“He presented himself as an athlete, gave the urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour," growled Kip Keino, chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya to the news agency Reuters.
There is no information yet about whether the runner faces some consequences about the incident.
Where is everyone?
The athletics stadium in Rio is empty
When the Brazilian medal hopefuls Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volley at legendary Copacabana, only 70 per cent of the stands were full.
“There are still 1.1 million tickets left to be sold”, Andrada said according to Reuters.
From the 8.5 million tickets in the London Olympics 8.2 million were sold, even though they were almost half more expensive than in Rio.
In Rio, the ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros for the opening.
Over half of the tickets cost under 16 euros.
There were plenty of empty seats in the Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even beach volley at the sands of Copacabana did not interest the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
The Foundation’s first land property is located in Lapland.
“There is no need to carry banners or to chain yourself to something in order to protect the nature”, explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired a Guardianship for his company.
Leviäkangas thinks the only risk in his nature conservation purchase is if the Foundation’s operations change from its original idea.
The risk is for the Foundation to act in unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas in a way they can stay unspoiled and at peace.
The Helsinki Foundation showcases its operations in a pop up forest at Helsinki Market Square from August 13 to 19.
This year there have been more stolen bicycles per capita than any of the other nine big cities.
Based on the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat describes how many bicycles and their parts have been stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August this year per capita.
According to the police information, there were four to five bike thefts per a thousand residents.
“For example Espoo is a completely different city, where city centres are far from each other, and bicycle is not necessarily the primary mode of transport”, Reen says.
There is still no great reason for joy.
In truth, the thieves take even more bikes, because only a part of the victims report a theft to the police.
Reen encourages people to report bike thefts, even if less than one in every ten reported cases are solved.
A typical solved bike theft is a case, where the police is immediately notified of the theft, and the thief is caught right away.
According to him, bicycles are stolen for example from a shopping centre bicycle stands, from courtyards, storerooms and bicycle basements, so practically from everywhere people usually store them.
A U-lock gives a bicycle better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take a bicycle for example for their own, brief use, but most of the stolen bicycles end up for sale for example online.
Buyers of stolen bikes are normal Finnish people, according to the police.
Some probably buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
A used bike buyer must be cautious, because they could commit a concealment offence or a criminal concealment.
“The alarm bells should be ringing, if a bicycle in good condition is being sold dirt cheap”, Reen says.
Siiri Valve, who briefly did business in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small U-lock.
“I think about this a lot, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own”, says the Helsinki student about her white bicycle, the frame of which alone cost about 500 euros.
“I keep hearing from my friends that bikes have been taken.”
A bike was stolen from Valve herself from a house courtyard a year ago.
Other consequences could be for example a letter written to the family explaining, what has been done and what has been learnt from it.
Youth work director Tommi Laitio says it is not a strict model.
The idea is that after their first crime, the young person doesn’t have to stand in front of an adult panel, but can reflect what has happened together with other people of approximately the same age.
The model has been tested once.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to sign a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
According to the newspaper, the letter is directed to the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
The signees want the party’s money to be put toward congressional races, instead of Trump’s campaign.
According to the letter, this should not be a difficult decision, as Trump’s chances of being elected president are evaporating by the day.
The letter ticks off a series of Donald Trump actions that are believed to have alienated millions of voters.
He is said to also have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Clinton promises relief to U.S. families with children
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shared details of his economic policy on Thursday evening.
This would be financed partly with tax increases for the rich, partly with private money.
Clinton called this programme the greatest investment in well-paid jobs since the Second World War.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to building!
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation of working families with children.
On Thursday, she sounded like Sanders anyway as she emphasised that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes.
On Thursday, Clinton emphasised that she herself is a daughter of a small entrepreneur.
So far, the Rio Olympic games haven’t reached huge viewer ratings.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
Even on the television side, the viewers are divided between TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The viewer ratings are lower than in London 2012 or Beijing 2008, but one reason for this is the time difference - most of the Rio games are broadcast in Finland during the night time.
In addition, the athletics is only just beginning, as well as other sports that interest Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the ratings of the beginning were close to what was expected.
By Monday, the application had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I guess that now we're somewhere around 200,000 downloads.
“We will get the online ratings only later”, says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked as desired with all the users.
Pokkinen says they've had feedback and have managed to fix the bugs.
There are now updated versions of the applications that should fix these bugs.
In addition for the Olympics being possible the most laborious ever for Yle, they are also the last one that can be followed only from Yle channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, it's depth being 95,3 metres at Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
The method does not necessarily find a small hollow from a hundred metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So for now the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi, and Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as much as Päijänne.
If the deepest lake is defined by its average depth, it would be Suuri Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
This way examined, Päijänne is not among the top ten of the deepest , and Suvasvesi is even farther from the top.
Pensioners’ taxation is still tighter than the wage-earners’.
Ihalainen says this disadvantage emerged just before the general election, and it was promised the pensioners’ taxation would be made more equal compared to the wage-earners.
We think it should definitely be there.
Given promises should be kept after the election, he says to Lännen Media.
In the beginning of this year, wage-earners got income tax deductions that reduces the taxation.
Purchasing power secured, will not grow
He says the tax deduction has a positive impact on purchase power and employment, if there are no other things that add to people’s uncertainty.
It is necessary, because the economy relies so much on the domestic demand and on people's own optimism about the future.
Prolonged unemployment must be discussed in the government budget session
In June, there were 17,000 more long-term unemployed people than a year before.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, currently there are very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact numbers are difficult to estimate.
Most travellers to Thailand this time of year come from Southern Europe and China.
After the bomb attacks, the Finnish Embassy has got some comments via Facebook from Finns in Thailand.
The Embassy has attempted to contact especially those Finns that are in Hua Hin, in order to get information about the town’s situation.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
According to Westphalen, there is no information about who is responsible for the attack.
Thailand police: The attacks are not international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and differ from customary terrorist attacks.
Also Islamic terrorism has been ruled out, Thailand police report according to the news agency AP.
According to current information, they did not claim any lives.
The paper says two of the bombs exploded on Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the paper.
Both double bombings killed at least one.
Both bombings killed at least one.
The quarter responsible for the attacks is not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, head of the military junta ruling Thailand, the quarter responsible for the attacks is so far not known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
Those Finns that are planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their journey because of the explosions, but they should follow the Embassy’s advice about caution, says Westphalen.
So far, there is very little information about the attacks that happened during the Finnish night time or their victims.
There are at least German, Italian, Dutch, and Austrian people among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in the second Hua Hin attack.
According to the province governor, the Surat Thani bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
At least one was wounded.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
She has 8 personal world championships from three previous seasons.
First a tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Huovila’s company offices are located a few hundred metres from the bomb attack scene.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called him about nine o’clock local time and said he should not come to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and the main street, Bangla Road, were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace as usual in the morning.
They thought the road blocks were set up because of the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm, and the businesses on the main street were allowed to open at around 10 local time.
Later the car in question was spotted in Jouxholmintie, Kruunupyy.
When the police reached the place, the car was set on fire.
The patrol saw two men that fit the descriptions hiding in a nearby spruce copse.
Ivanov’s successor is a 44-year old Anton Vaino of Estonian background.
He is an ex-diplomat and has been Ivanov’s deputy.
He adds that rotating leadership tasks is one way of using power.
A drop in status for Ivanov
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in status.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people on the top or Russian power.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields while retreating in Syria
They used the civilians as human shields as they withdrew to Jarabulus, thus preventing us from targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars, where they were taken to Jarabulus.
It is estimated, though, that dozens of jihadists remained in the town then.
The Minister justified his decision with the instructions by the Prime Minister’s Office and with the fact that the information was entered in the Minister’s calendar, not in the accounting material.
Usain Bolt’s final Olympic show begins in Rio
Early in the season, he hurt his back thigh, and had to pass Olympic qualifications in Jamaica.
It has not been the perfect build-up but I am in much better shape
That press conference included scantily clad Samba dancers and reporters that had turned into fans.
The murmuring around Bolt underlines that fact that the star of the Jamaican has risen during the age when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest.
This is harder
A year later in the World Championship in Berlin, Bolt reached the culmination of his career when measured with time.
Last year in Beijing WC finals Bolt won the American by only one hundredth of a second.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the pack.
But anytime I start feeling really down, I remind myself, you have got to get this done this year, Bolt said three months ago in a Sports Illustrated interview.
Also Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is suspected of a doping offence.
Silvia Danekova has tested positive for EPO hormone.
She was fourth in Rio in women’s 100 m breaststroke.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has requested a hearing of her doping case with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS.
There have also been other suspected doping crimes in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won already 22 Olympic golds.
Phelps’ winning time was 1.54,66.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Television is a visual media, she emphasises.
It is important to look good, and small sensations are only a fun thing.
This is not about me, she states.
It shouldn’t matter so much how I dress myself.
Can you imagine that the sensation has reached Finland, too?
You know what?
I’m a little amused, if this has hit someone’s radar.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before releasing them.
All the suspected have been Brazilians.
The arrested people are suspected of having contact with extremist organisation Isis.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to begin their Rio's basketball tournament early division match in an empty hall on Thursday.
This was the third time during Rio Olympics that the police performed a controlled detonation task.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package there.
The audience did not make it to the stands by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while because of a suspicious package found from the hall.
The police detonated the package and let the audience in only after that.
This was the third time during Rio’s summer Olympics that the police performed a controlled detonation task.
The last time police had to detonate a suspicious finding was last Saturday, near a road cycling goal place.
Spain and Nigeria began their match in Rio basketball tournament’s early division in front of empty stands.
A lady from Argentina shoved Petäjä-Siren - the Finn is thinking about protesting
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had difficulties on Thursday.
An Argentinian lady shoved Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio, in the opening start of the women's windsurfing.
The opponent admitted the offence.
She got stuck because of the crash, and others got away, told Joakim Wilenius, Finland’s head coach.
For a long time, the athlete thought about protesting.
Edited 0.39: Deviating from the original information, Petäjä-Siren did’nt make a protest.
7 curious things that, according to science, prolong your life
Science has studied everything possible between the heaven and the earth.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person’s life.
Sometimes the things a person can’t influence themselves can bring them extra years.
Going shopping regularly can prolong your life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most peculiar research results.
According to science, all of these things may bring you more years for your life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Those who laughed more were 35 per cent more likely to still be alive at the end of the study.
Sex, when the protection against STDs is taken into consideration, is good for your health according to many studies.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is, is not enough.
One explanation could be that an ambitious person most likely lives in a way that brings extra years to their life.
A totally drunk driver swerved against a lorry
The accident took place at Koski, halfway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie, on Friday at 9 pm.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The car swerved to a ditch and continued over the ditch ending on its top.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car, and she was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was at Salo’s K-Citymarket on Thursday buying bulk sweets, when she saw a funny sign.
Unfortunately there are shortages in our bulk sweet selection, because Posti delivered our order to Seinäjoki!
Jaakko Kaidesoja, Posti’s Vice President of the Freight Services for companies, apologized for the mishap to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background for this is that three of five pallets lost their way and ended up in a wrong place (Seinäjoki), and we didn’t do a partial delivery (to Salo) at three o’clock, but delivered the five pallets only today, Kaidesoja said to Ilta-Sanomat.
The first to report about this was Ilta-Sanomat.
Huge weight-loss! Lotta Backlund lost 30 kilos and published a picture of her change
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos following a change of lifestyle.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness regimen with a goal of being normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund began his dieting already in 2009.
On Friday, Backlund shared a pair of pictures about her huge accomplishment on Instagram.
You are amazing.
Happy, smart, a good sense of humour, not afraid of work.
A good friend.
We still can’t fully comprehend that she’s gone.
The status update mentions that all the donated money goes entirely to police dogs, mainly for purchasing body armour vests.
Last Friday a 42-year old woman from Loviisa was murdered on her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The District Court enjoined Posti to pay the employee most of the retained wages and 2000 euros as compensation for discrimination.
The District Court said the employee had been, against the Anti-Discrimination Act, placed in an unfavourable position based on their trade unionism.

At Flow, megalomania is a virtue
For us, it has never been enough just to have a main stage and a beer tent, says the Artistic Director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
Flow Festival, organised in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event with tens of thousands visitors.
The goal has been to increase the last year’s number of visitors, 70.000, by 5.000 people.
The growth of the visitor number is a good thing, because the operations have to funded someway.
On the other hand, we don't want to grow too much, because at some point the masses would be like cattle that is herded in huge channels.
We don’t want that.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented also in a simpler way.
In the early years of the event, mid 00s, the operation was very dependent on the support of about 20.000 euros from the city of Helsinki.
However, the event has not purposely profiled itself as especially fashionable.
We are interested in everything, history and future.
Iggy’s latest album was bloody good, and he has performed bloody well on his gigs in recent years.
The bombs in Thai tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - horrified tourists escaped
On Thursday evening local time, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died and over 20 were wounded in the attack.
The bombs were probably hidden in a flower pot and then detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were located on a street where most of the customers are foreign.
If the tweet isn’t visible, you can see it here.
At least 11 of those wounded in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
At least one died.
The number of the wounded is not yet known.
At the same time there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb went off in the town of Trang.
The police said they had found at least one bomb from Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, those responsible for the bomb attacks are most likely rebel groups that are not satisfied with the actions of Thailand’s military leadership.
According to Aftonbladet, the police has lately been snapping at the criminal organisations dealing in human trafficking.
In an acute war situation, the conscripts won’t be sent to battle until several months after they have sworn their oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hard argument about a house they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been 330,000 euros.
After the closing of the deal, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing unhealthy microbe growth.
The couple filed the matter in court and there claimed a price reduction from the seller.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal passed judgement on the matter on Wednesday.
In addition, the seller has to cover the couple’s legal and settlement costs for a total of 47,000 euros.
However, according to the Court of Appeals, the construction defects that appeared were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a house in good condition
Within a few years it appeared that the humidity problems of the house were much more serious than previously thought.
Mould or yeast that enables a health risk and exceeds the limit values was found in smear samples taken from the utility room, basement staircase, living room bay window, and basement washroom.
The patios were built without permits.
For example the patios had been built even though there were no proper permits yet.
According to the Court of Appeal, based on the information they got from the seller before the deal, the buyers had reason to assume that the building was suitable for living as is, and that there was no need for large repairs in the near future.
The Race office operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
The same was even more true to women, who had to be able to give birth to even more than 10 children.
The goal was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women’s family tree.
Instead, the Nazi population policies were focused on family and marriage.
Petäjä-Siren sixth, Nirkko rose and dropped
Nirkko rose to eighth place in the total points after five starts, but the failure in the second start dropped him to place 14.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought for places 17 and three in the day’s RS:X class’ starts.
Petäjä-Siren is sixth in the total points.
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finns’ favourite artists already for over 20 years.
In the book Sillanpää narrates his life and career, be it positive or negative.
Sillanpää’s career soared when he won the crown of the Tango King at Seinäjoki Tangomarkkinat festival in 1995.
In the competition Sillanpää sang tangos, but already then he had planned somewhat different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango for Sillanpää at his request, and Kassu Halonen then arranged it to a slightly different form.
The book tells that the recording of the song did not quite go according to plans: Sillanpää had a terrible hangover when he sang the song on tape, and he had only slept for a couple of hours.
I was so hung-over!
Sillanpää recalls in the book.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the result was still good.
In 2013, Sillanpää separated from his then partner, and the incident also ended up in the texts of ‘Sinä ansaitset kultaa’ song that was published as a single in 2014.
The book relates that the lyrics that were commissioned from Saara Törmänen weren't what Sillanpää would've wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined he was doing a record that tells a true story of his own life, but the lyrics of the song about break-up weren’t true, but written based on a piece of news from 7 päivää magazine.
In the end, 52 per cent of the voters supported the exit and 48 per cent would have stayed in the union, even though the opinion polls from the vote week anticipated an opposite result.
They were shocked, when it seemed that economy was not the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly speech
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters based their decision on something other than economic grounds.
One economist explanation for the loss of economy's position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many also have an impression that it would be a good thing if the value of the currency fell, since it promotes the exporting industries.
The overwhelming winning argument in the Brexit vote concerned immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will jam your hospitals, an immigrant will abuse you.
Every cafe has foreign employees.
How much easier would it be for a Brit to have a doctor's appointment, if they weren’t here?
I feel these are economic questions.
Immigrants, and above all EU immigrants, are net contributors to the British public economy, and their spending creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit with cash
According to him, Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by working out A and B plans.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
This is the highest amount in nine open-end real estate funds, Vanhanen says about all open-end real estate funds in Britain.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit can be a big risk for commercial real estate actors.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
These together turned the situation upside down, and highlighted the issue in the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
This made the investors nervous.
The snowball began to roll, and a fund after another had to close its doors.
The Aberdeen situation was good because of the collected cash assets, but in the end it, too, had to freeze its trade for six days.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
The Aberdeen stop lasted six days, and the company sold less than 10 of its 80 estates located in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
The pound and dollar rates are lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15 per cent discount on the market compared to pre-Brexit vote time period.
Brexit brought drawbacks to London property market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation did not yet look too good.
He headed for work straight away.
When the market opened, the terminals were all blinking red.
Not just because, despite the turbulence, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finalised two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote, at Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confused.
The Brexit vote began a correction
According to him, it is still too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
So much is still open: how the exit will happen, and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The price development data from a real estate service company CBRE cover about a third of the market.
Vanhanen thinks that this comparison is not quite apposite, because this is a homespun British crisis.
We could have faced a correction in any case
For two years now, we have said that the City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
And, on top of that, loan has been easily available, even though Vanhanen says that the leverage has been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Even Aberdeen began to lighten their holdings in London, and was indeed a net seller last year.
Vanhanen has already seen several up and down movements, because he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
If you are well prepared for risks, you have a better position.
He believes in global diversification.
If you have invested too much in one market, you are its victim.
S Group to start registering shopping information more closely
Item-specific information is gathered with the consent of the customer, and it is used to marketing subject to permission.
The most effective channel is email.
According to him, Kesko will not react to S Group’s registering change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers to ten different groups simply based on groceries alone.
The regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchased items and the money used.
Item-specific information is gathered only from K-Group’s own chains.
Partners, like for example Neste Oil, do not give away their information.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus customer loyalty programme one can join in a Valintatalo, Siwa or Euromarket.
However, Ora does not promise that they would start registering item information.
The basic information includes personal data and address information, but also profession, education, mode of living, as well as children's year of birth, and previous personal data.
Also the people living in the same household and their roles have been registered.
Information about the purchase date, time, and place, the total amount of shopping and the method of payment has been saved from an S-Card purchase.
In addition, the S-Bonus partners’ information has been received from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase information will be saved in Sokos and Emotion chains.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
The information is stored at the cash registers anyway, whether you want it or not.
Those who want can check their saved information on the S Group website.
For example cashiers cannot access the information, Saarikoski points out.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila by using its favourite toy to play with the dog.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused the customs to take measures, and after the attacks, control has been strengthened, says Supervision Director Mikko Grönberg from the Customs.
Another main reason for training an arms and explosives dog for the Customs, are the postal items that are carried via Helsinki airport.
In recent years, the Customs has discovered about 300 findings related to guns, gun parts, ammunition and explosive materials and their basic materials from the Helsinki airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki airport.
It will examine registered luggage and postal items.
Grönberg is hopeful about that.
A school at Kirkkonummi
Puppy Heila’s training is coordinated by the Customs Dog Training Centre, located at Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila will also be trained by the Police and Finnish Defence Forces experts.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the Customs’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
There still are placement tests ahead, the next one in October, when it will be assessed whether the training is adequate for the exacting work tasks.
Their work age is about seven to eight years, possibly even ten, after which they retire to their owner’s care.
Drama in Rio - Finnish lifter fainted after a huge performance
During heavy lifts or right after them he has lost consciousness many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
His body was shaking under the weight, until the judges approved of the jerk.
RoPS acquired Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who play in men’s premier football division in Finland, has made contract until the end of the season with the Estonian forward Albert Prosa.
Little by little, Prosa began to stand out as a good option, said RoPS coach Juha Malinen in a press release.
RoPS had a need for a new forward, when their last season’s goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Voluptuous Modern Family star causes a stir again: the teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
The young woman has also been seen wearing extremely skimpy outfits.
If the image isn’t visible, you can see it here.
Back then, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter is experiencing a "typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
She has been on television for nearly her whole life, and she has grown up in the Kardashian era.
Winter began in Modern Family when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has annoyed some of her long-time fans with this change in her image.
You look amazing!
The purpose of the campaign is to tempt the Japanese to begin their aurora trips already early in the autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main attractions for the Japanese aurora travel are Inari and Levi.
During autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of a lake reflects the aurora, thus making the vision twice as fantastic, acting Marketing Manager Anne Lind describes in the press release.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland using for example online advertising.
Researchers from Aalto University and from universities of Turku and Tokyo carried out a survey, according to which Finland’s country image is exceptionally strong and positive among the Japanese when compared to other Nordic countries.
The overnight stays of Japanese tourists have grown significantly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
Which is pretty much how it is.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes using tax havens.
The Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but this was not enough for the demonstrators.

The Democratic Party was furious about this and demanded an apology from Trump.
The ruling also states that beachwear which ostentatiously displays religious affiliation is liable to create risks of disrupting public order in France, which has been a target for terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people were killed and hundreds hurt in Nice, when a 31-year old man drove to a crowd celebrating French national holiday.
Swim water quality in Oulu region passed the screening - blue-green algae opacity at Pyykösjärvi
The water samples collected from the official beaches in Oulu region meet the quality demands set for swim water.
Pyykösjärvi beach is the only one with observed blue-green algae.
The Environmental Office of Oulu Region took water samples during Tuesday and Wednesday from the nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, all the other beaches’ E.coli and intestinal Enterococcus bacteria levels in swim waters were below the action limits set in the decrees by Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and intestinal Enterococcus bacteria levels at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacteria levels had declined and were under the action limits.
Blue-green algae opacity found from Pyykösjärvi beach does not in itself make the water unsuitable for swimming, but if the conditions are favourable, the situation can develop to algal blooms quite fast, and then there will be blue-green algae mass sheets formed on the water surface.
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the next year’s budget proposal by the Ministry of Finance.
A forest owner would make the deduction from the pure income from forest capital.
Generally speaking, the idea of doing a tool such as this to promote forest properties’ generational change is good, commented the Forestry Director Juha Hakkarainen of the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen did find points of criticism from the tax change proposal.
The forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the pure capital income of the forest owner.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater, if the deduction could be made straight from the wood sales proceeds.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complicated.
An average forest owner is not able to piece it together, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, he says, the model only affects a small part of forest owners.
Hakkarainen thinks this is too high.
This model would have an effect on about 10 per cent of forest owners, he says.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift deduction has been talked about for decades.
The reason behind it is the aging of forest owners.
According to MTK, at the moment, the average age of forest owners is over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A heavy hailstorm surprised the motorists at Himanka - two cars fell into a ditch and collided with each other
According to the fire master on duty, Harri Pyyhtiä, the falling is suspected to be caused by a heavy hailstorm.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The study results have been published 4 August in a prestigious cellular biology publication, Nature Communications.
One got 8 years and 4 months for manslaughter and for aggravated robbery as a young person, among other things.
According to the District Court, in last July the two 17-year old young men killed a man who worked as a supervisor at a foster home under a reformatory school.
The supervisor managed to disentangle himself from the hold, leading the young person to his room, when the other of young person hit him with a vacuum cleaner pipe.
The supervisor was also strangled with a cord, hit, and kicked to the head.
According to the mental examination, both of the condemned were of sound mind in the time of the crime.
According to the Court, the youth had planned an escape from the foster home at least since the previous day.
The researchers revealed the age with radiocarbon dating.
Presenting his tax programme on Monday in Detroit, Trump described it as revolutionary.
Corporate tax would decrease from 35 per cent to 15 per cent.
Inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Free trade agreements would be cancelled.
As to its level, Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere in between those two works.
The story is a simple one, and largely told in flashbacks.
Life seems to be going well for the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then all threatens to fall apart.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts her life story to her grownup daughter.
The short stories have been published in the book Runaway: Stories.
Directed and manuscript by: Pedro Almodóvar.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film will be released on August 12.
There will be no new cuts, the ministers keep on saying, so that the Finns Party would not completely collapse.
There will be no new cuts.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security, and nearly all the other benefits tied to national pension index are being cut 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will shorten from 500 days to 400 days.
The municipal elections are haunting
Because next year is an election year.
Four years ago the Finns Party got 752 new municipal councillors, most of whom will see the cost of working in a right-wing government realised next spring.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year everything will most likely be different - if Sipilä’s government is still standing.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to put their hands up already halfway through the electoral term and to admit that the government is unable to follow their own program: the indebtedness is not broken or even slowed down.
The second is to hold on to their program.
The budget would be forced at least close to a balance during 2018, and then, in the spring, it would be just accepting whatever is coming in the general elections.
It is completely obvious that the current actions will not be enough to break the indebtedness, no matter how much Juha Sipilä attempts to whip up a positive atmosphere.
Unemployment now costs 3 billion euros more annually than it did in 2008.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected, because it was considered to be irresponsible.
A survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Under-age drunken driver ran away from the police after a chase
The chase continued to Sonkajanrannantie, where it further proceeded to Sorronahontie and to a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
He also did not have a driver’s licence that would have permitted to drive on a motorcycle.
The incident is being investigated as aggravated endangering of road safety, among other things.
A lorry with a load of rocks toppled over into a ditch on Kaavintie, Polvijärvi, on Thursday evening around 9.15 pm.
The lorry had drifted out of the road on a left curve, and toppled over into a ditch.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car's owner.
The police is investigating the cause of the accident.

According to a study, Londoners’ skin ages faster than normal.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The results show that the skin of many senior London citizens will be the equivalent of two-and-a-half years older than that of someone in the countryside.
It has been discovered in studies that the particles are small enough to penetrate the skin’s outer layer.
The man had moved rocks on his yard using a tractor.
When he got off the tractor and walked in front of it, the tractor’s brakes gave out and it slowly ran over the man.
The tractor did not run any further, because it hit the rocks that were in front of it.
Riento has a new impetus for the coming season

Jani Säisä, who continues as Riento’s main coach, praises the new team as energetic and consistent.
From Josba, Kataja, and Jokipojat to team USA
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every floorball world championships since 2003.
I was working in Turku and played for a local women's club when I saw the ad.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in the town of Elizabeth near new York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen got in to Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no national level in floorball yet.
Jumppanen played floorball in the Finnish national league in 1991-92 in the university’s club, and the following next year was spent in Josba.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen nominated for the national team
Perttu Puska, originally from a Joensuu floorball team Josba, and Tatu Väänänen from Eno, were appointed to the Finnish national team that play in EFT tournament in Brno, Czech Republic, on 6.-8. November.
The main coach of the floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontionlahti.
Essi Hasu is about finish her career as a beach volley player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish Championships in beach volley are settled during the weekend in Kouvola’s Urheilupuisto.
Hasu, who currently lives in Helsinki, eagerly awaits for games in front of a familiar crowd.
I hope as many as possible can make it to the stands this weekend.
I started playing volleyball in Elimäen NMKY's E girls when I was nine.
In a small place, a sports club was a tight community where everyone knew each other.
Beach volley has been played at Käyrälampi beach already in the 1990s.
Now this dream comes true, when this weekend Hasu is playing in the FC finals together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki.
Our realistic goal is a medal.
Yes, my international career will be over after Kisakallio tournament.
According to newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there was a total of about 200 people inside the tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
According to the newspaper, the future of the event hangs in the balance.

Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
We will always have the breaststroke, and long may it reign.
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be a regional ignorance.
But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.
Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
It is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.
Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
For the last decade, it has been one Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
But that may be changing.
The complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
"That," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very tight rope to walk."
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.
The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.
Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.
These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he'll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.
The new location has other perks.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.

Chilli-powder condoms, firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn.
One whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.
A last resort is a launcher that shoots a Roman candle firework into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room with a bunch of people I love, looking at this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a league unto itself.
The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.
The revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that, in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.
This sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenner's Vogue cover appearance.
She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
And, in her downtime, possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids, she's on reality television.
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
Desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
