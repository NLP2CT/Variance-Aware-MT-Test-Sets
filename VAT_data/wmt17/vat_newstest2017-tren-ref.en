28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.

Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson sacked after hitting producer
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.
The show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September.

Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket.
They were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was watching over these guys today.
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.

Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
It's not a coincidence.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
A witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about while pregnant.
When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.
"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly meeting some milestones.
He's walking with help, and riding a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers, and singing.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic ones like Edmund's, and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.
It gets better.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.
It came up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.
Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.
Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.
Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
The ¬£2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.

CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
Thanks for that.
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.
But the experiment, which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results.
The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things.
From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
In the movie made about it he said: 'Ever since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil, eating worms and muddy water.'
The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units, when freshly washed hands are less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
He said in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.'
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.
Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
We did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian."
They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'
Naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Tourists in Portugal are left terrified as a low-flying military jet flies skims beach
Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'
The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.
He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.

Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.

Vinyl destination: who is actually buying records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."
So, let's take a look.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation.
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.
"I suppose I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?
It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular.
It's an easy way to occupy your headspace.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.
"Someone came in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says.
That's not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.
We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
It's easy to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh.
I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
Nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration, some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is pure "art vinyl."
But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.

The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, it was touch and go.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
So is Bam.
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.
Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampol√≠n, meaning "diving board."
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.
They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," according to the official Olympic program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games.
He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.
"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Is Ethiopia about to crack?
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
"If you suffocate people and they don't have any other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He introduced new ingredients.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and saut√©ed onions are available.
There are brown-rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003.
He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.
"Quarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other perks.
A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like p√¢t√© de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
Previously many used spears to defend themselves.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom, its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
One whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to Iranian citizens.
It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
"I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Some interesting details have started to come to light regarding the Chairman of the Executive Board of the Kavuklar Group, Abdullah Kavuk and the Chairman of the Executive Board of the K√º√ß√ºkbay Group, Ahmet K√º√ß√ºkbay, who were detained because they provided financial support to FETO.
It was suggested that banks participate in the campaign stage which Emlak Konut started and which GYODER then participated in.
It was the public banks that launched the discount rush.
5 OR 10 YEAR OPTION
Interest rates are expected to drop more in the coming days.
GYODER President Aziz Torun: It should be reduced to less than 9 percent a year
It is an important step for public banks to cut interest rates.
They paid close attention to the appeal by our President and reduced interest rates.
However, this rate should fall to under 9 percent a year.
If this cutting process continues, we are thinking of extending the 0.70 monthly interest campaign that we started for several more months.
Kuzu Group Member of the Board √ñzen Kuzu: Our campaign may be extended by 3 months
Apart from that, there are a certain number of steps taken towards the revival of the economy in all sectors.

Interest rates fall, houses increase in price
Always the same thing happens.
He says that the contractors who entered the Emlak Konut campaign with a 0.70 interest rate have increased prices in many housing projects.
I checked to see if there were any truth to this.

Appeal from BDDK: Complain to those banks
We say to those who bring these kinds of complaints and this information to us, 'Make an application to the BDDK complaint line by giving the names on the basis of bank and company.'
When interest rates were 7-8% per annum, banks earned money from these transactions.

Galatasaray Club President, Dursun √ñzbek, was elected as the council chairman.
The table was furnished with Turkish flags for the purpose of emphasizing Turkey's unity and solidarity.
"WE WILL CLEAN OUR GARDEN"
Indicating that those who tried to commit a traitorous attack on Turkey's indivisible integrity found the great Turkish people against them, Turkish Clubs Union Head, G√∂ksel G√ºm√º≈üdaƒü, said, "We do not have the luxury of underestimating FETO entity."

FETO ringleader G√ºlen's assets were seized
H√ºseyin G√ºlerce: G√ºlen's demise depends on the collapse of 3 stands
Commenting on the coup attempt by FETO, H√ºseyin G√ºlerce made striking statements.
The headlines from H√ºseyin G√ºlerce's statements are as follows:
He is certainly receiving support from the CIA.
Mahmut √ñv√ºr said in 2014 that Fuat Doƒüu and Fetullah G√ºlen had a meeting at Vehbi Ko√ß's house in 1971.
After Mahmut Bey's article, there were no statements to deny it.
For example, Adil √ñks√ºz was caught in the base, was he not?
It is wondered who he is.
The guy went to Pennsylvania 2 times within the last 25 days before the coup attempt, and came back 2 days before.
Adil √ñks√ºz went abroad 109 times since 2002.
It will be seen that they went to Pennsylvania for some reason.
I said that Fuat Avni is an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania 2 years before.
The only thing to break the political support is authentication of the fact that the tapes of Baykal and MHP managers were taken by FETO.
After July 15, esteemed Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu is also using "FETO"; everyone has opened their eyes.
G√ºlen is such a trickster that he says, "I did not do it, those around me did it."
Two terrorists were neutralized in the clash after the police responded.
The wounded officer was brought to Nusaybin State Hospital.
See this hero, Asƒ±m Akkaya...
They held a gun to my head and wanted me to cut the broadcast.
I shut down only local TV.
After that I said that we need to go to the dish antennas to make them move away from the building.
I spent around 20 minutes in the section in which there are antennas.
When the coup plotters could not succeed in cutting the broadcast in T√ºrksat, they brought experts from Samanyolu TV.
That night, I took over guard duty at 8 o'clock.
That place was entrusted to us.
My friends were on duty in the e-State and electrical system respectively.
We saw their lights.
They were flying in front of the helicopters.
While watching the news we learned that the bridge was closed.
TRT broadcasts were cut for 5 minutes.
I called the TRT program controller but I could not reach anyone.
Our control station said that TRT broadcasts came back on-air and the announcement started to be read.
A short while ago we heard Prime Minister Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m say, "there is an attempt."
We hid in a building at the back.
We were 12 people in total.
When we went back, the soldiers disembarking from the helicopter entered inside.
The soldiers talked among themselves.
After that they made all of us sit inside.
Their commanders started to shout, "Who is in charge here, I won't ask again."
At that moment I felt that I gave up on my life.
I said, 'it is me.'
This room came to my mind.
After all, we faced up to the fact that we won't be able to get out from there.
I said, 'OK, I will cut.'
I cut the antenna output of one of the local channel packages.
I cut the power button going to the monitors in which we can watch the national channels.
I said that I needed to go to the antennas to completely cut them.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, one of the soldiers said, "stop there."
He held the gun to my forehead.
He said, 'You will cut all of them except TRT, there will be none remaining, I will shoot one of you sooner or later, it will be you.'
As I had already given up on my life, I said without fear, 'When you go, you will see that all of them are frozen', I did not say anything else.
We entered the station and I cut the local broadcasts.
We passed to the other antenna.
At that time there was a system that corresponded to around 20 national channels.
They believed the answers we gave.
After leaving the antenna they asked where the transformer was.
I said, 'I don't know I am a TV broadcaster', he asked, 'Is there an electrician.'
I said, 'There is no electrician in the evening after working hours, if there is a malfunction a team comes.'
It occurred to me that I did not cut the Cyprus broadcasts.
I was thinking about cutting them to stall the soldiers.
They felt relieved because they thought that the broadcasts were cut.
They did not think of looking at the broadcasts.
He said, 'stand up.'
I stood up.
He said, 'there are channels broadcasting in Cyprus.'
I said, 'they are broadcasting through Cyprus, we cannot do anything to them.'
I saw from the photos that the soldier who brought me to the toilet and gave me water was killed on the seat of that minibus.
They fired 3 times to his forehead and shot him in his cheeks.
My friends also confirmed that he was the soldier.
Possibly he was a private soldier that did his military service.
They may have executed him to get rid of him.
According to Asƒ±m Akkaya's expressions, the first police squad came to T√ºrksat from G√∂lba≈üƒ±.
Daƒükapƒ± spirit after Yenikapƒ±
The AK Party will make a group visit to Diyarbakƒ±r, Van and Mardin with a large delegation consisting of businessmen, artists, sportsmen and opinion leaders to build "heart bridges" with the citizens in the region at the beginning of September.
The works started under the chairmanship of Mehmet M√ºezzinoƒülu, Vice President, Chairman of Civil Society Public Relations.
Meetings will be held before the festival in these 3 provinces to be used as centers.
Businessmen, artists, sportsmen and opinion leaders will also participate in the activities.
It will be ensured that the aid activities will be conducted by 3 parties together.
It is thought that HDP will not be invited to the activities in Yenikapƒ±.
Adil √ñks√ºz's father in law spoke
Father-in-law Cevat Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m and mother-in-law Hatice Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m were released by the court on the condition of judicial control and an international travel ban.
Speaking after leaving the court house, Cevat Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m made an appeal to his son-in-law to surrender and said the following: "I stand with the state."
I do not have a son-in-law named Adil √ñks√ºz.
If he made a mistake, he will serve his sentence.
Stating that he does not want Turkey to become Syria, Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m said, "We do not need a coup, we need work."
We do not want Turkey to become like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
It has a president like Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan.
FETO operation at the university: 30 in detention
In the operation organized under the instruction of the Izmir Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, there are professors among those who were detained.
The detained prosecutor attempted to commit suicide
After the talks, Mayor Yaƒücƒ±, ≈ûeyh Edebali University Prsident Prof. Dr. ƒ∞brahim Ta≈ü, Provincial National Education Director, Fazilet Durmu≈ü, Provincial Health Director, Yƒ±lmaz, Provincial Community Health Director, √ñmer Balcƒ±, Deputy Secretary of Public Hospitals, Serkan Kadir Keskin, and Green Crescent Foundation Bilecik Branch Deputy Director, Hilal Savran, signed the protocol.
He saw the conspiracy in Ergenekon, FETO killed him
The gun said to be used by left handed Oktay to shoot himself was found in his right hand.
In addition, fractures in his ribs and marks from blows to his body were detected.
He was acquitted at the end of the trial.
THOSE PROSECUTORS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED
Beh√ßet Oktay's sister ≈ûule Oktay, brother Nezih Oktay and family lawyers made many requests during the trial process.
While all the requests of the family were rejected, it was revealed that Oktay was wiretapped as a Hezbollah Terrorist Organization member with the fake name "Abdurrahman Doƒüru" 6 days before he died.
The person who instructed the wiretapping was determined at the time to be Police Intelligence Department Director, Ramazan Aky√ºrek.
The case brought to the Ankara Heavy Penal Court for the illegal wiretapping of Oktay will start on September 19.
His sister ≈ûule Oktay said, "In fact this murder happened blatantly."
We could not perceive it.
My elder brother said, 'They will eat me' before he was killed.
I said, 'Who?'
I thought that he would be dismissed.
I did not think of death.

My chief went to Amasya.
They called me and went to an engagement at the Ankara Hilton.
He never opened the window.
They did heart massage and electroshock at the √áankaya Medical Center.
We brought him together to the Bayƒ±ndƒ±r Medical Center but it was too late.
I think that he was poisoned in Amasya by one of the family.
An autopsy was not performed on T√ºrke≈ü.
T√ºrke≈ü's grave should be reopened.
Was Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü killed?

There was a point on the bridge at which a big bus stopped.
That place was very crowded.
We stopped there and waited for some time.

The sky will be the scene of meteor showers
Esenoƒülu pointed out that the Perseid meteor was discovered for the first time in 1862 and started to be seen from earth since the 1990s.
Mentioning that the Perseid meteor shower can be seen in July and August, Esenoƒülu said, "We should watch and care about such a visual feast coming from the space."
They will sparkle red when they are cold, white when they are hot
He drew attention to the fact that some of the lentil-sized particles separated during the meteor shower will drop to earth, and continued as follows:
Because of the heat and friction in the atmosphere, the Perseid shower produces red light when cold and white light when hot in their natural environment.
A contribution can be made by writing how many meteors are seen on the website of the International Meteor Organization.
Explaining that the meteor shower travels at a speed of around 60 km/h, Esenoƒülu said that this visual feast in the sky can be well seen from places that receive little light in the northeast direction during the whole night.
Poorly educated, former football player Erdoƒüan
The above-written statement is the translation of a sentence in an article published in Foreign Policy last week.
In fact, if the statistics are looked at, the first ten years of Erdoƒüan's term can be interpreted as a period in which the opposition against the West in Turkey decreased or remained at an average position.
There are many reasons to be counted like the facts that Erdoƒüan criticized Israel with 'one-minute'; the E.U. could not put forward a clear policy over the outbreak of civil war as a result of the Assad government's massacres, and left Turkey alone in the refugee crisis; Some figures like European Parliament President Schulz showed contemptuous behavior as in the expression "Erdoƒüan is not our interlocutor"; An offend Erdogan competition was held and was won by the London Mayor at the time and now Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with his poem that includes many unimaginably disgusting swear words; PKK's Syria branch of YPG is glorified in Europe by opening both exhibitions and offices while PKK members that entered from Syria to Turkey became suicide bombers and slaughtered tens of our citizens; US soldiers in Syria wear uniforms with the YPG symbol; its special representative for the struggle against DAESH, Brett McGurk, paid special visits to the YPG; while the opposition groups that don't pose a threat to Turkey, such as the YPG, are left alone, all the intelligence and logistic supports are given to the YPG; Turkey's struggle against DAESH was underestimated and the number of our troops was decreased in Mosul because of Baghdad government oppression and USA support.
Again, Erdoƒüan still has not even said that he thinks the USA had an impact on the coup...
Was there any viewpoint other than likening Turkey's cities to Syria's cities for those who participated in this movement?
Why does a commissioned officer bomb the parliament of his own country?
The way of democracy, the way we know
The second biggest change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The contribution of roads and bridges to the modernization is more easily understood.
Demirel built the Bosphorus Bridge.
This was the peak of the post-1950s peasant movement in the 1960s.
Demiral and √ñzal's aim was to melt the big masses in the center.
Because the immigration continued at full speed.
The incoming people were placed in the satellite cities.
A somewhat closed system was created in those regions.
That is to say, history and sociology overlapped.
This is ensured via two bridges.
The first one is Osmangazi Bridge.
The second one is √áanakkale 1915 Bridge.
Do you know what this means? ƒ∞zmir will become an utterly different city from now on.
That's it!
The July 15 martyrs are the stars of this big adventure.
That person who made a complaint to G√ºlen about Aziz Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m...
When this person conveyed these remarks to G√ºlen, Fethullah G√ºlen became obsessed with Aziz Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m.
Why did he become obsessed with Aziz Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m?
After these words, another explanation came from Faik I≈üƒ±k, who is one of the most important lawyers in the Match-Fixing Case.
I≈üƒ±k participated in the TV program Kar≈üƒ±t G√∂r√º≈ü broadcast on Habert√ºrk, and announced the person who complained about Aziz Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m to FETO ringleader Fethullah G√ºlen.
Here are the remarks of Faik I≈üƒ±k:
Aziz Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m said something to ƒ∞hsan Kalkavan about Fethullah G√ºlen.

The price of sacrificial animals was announced
Drawing attention to the fact that the animals not to be sacrificed last year were put on sale, Karabulut talked about the things that citizens should look at when buying a sacrificial animal:
Moreover, it is also very important that the animal is healthy.
There should not be any indications like saliva, slime on its face.
We saw that animals that were not sacrificial last year were put on sale and sold.
A sacrificial animal needs to be 2 years old.
We understand this by looking at the animal's teeth.
Rize Airport will be constructed on the sea

Striking expressions from Robert Amsterdam about FETO!
Amsterdam shared the following opinions in his article:
According to the information we received from the denunciators, the G√ºlen organization has a rigid hierarchy in which instructions are conveyed.
These instructions are generally conveyed to Poconos during face to face meetings with G√ºlen.
This group conveys the instructions to the advisory committee.
Stating that the organization opened 55 thousand places of business all over the world and has the widest charter school network, Amsterdam said that millions of dollars are given to these schools from the taxes paid by American taxpayers every year.
Amsterdam wrote that most of this money is directed by the organization members and transferred to the "chosen" subcontracting companies.
Amsterdam explained this process with these examples:
Amsterdam showed Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
He added, "moreover, this is the visible part of what we found up until now."
Saying that, according to statements from a former American educator who worked in these schools, some employees in G√ºlen schools had separate meetings and transferred an amount from their wages to the organization, Amsterdam said, "It is believed that G√ºlen members in the Turkish Armed Forces are working in a similar way."
Coup plotters strengthened their position over the years.
Amsterdam finished his article as follows:
Search procedures are continuing for the 22 judges and prosecutors who could not be found at their addresses.

Faculty of Dentistry Associate Prof. Dr. Bilgin Giray said that children turn sucking into a necessity and relax through this reflex because they cannot chew at an early age.
Explaining the reasons why the thumb sucking habit is seen in children, Associate Prof. Dr. Giray said, "Thumb sucking is a circumstance seen from birth until 3-4 years of age."
Most babies suck their thumb.
Sucking their thumb to satisfy their need of sucking in infancy, children suck their thumb after 1-1,5 years of age to eliminate the mother's breast and to relax.
As a result of the pressure that takes place while sucking, the upper teeth are pushed forward and the lower teeth are pushed back.
It causes the lower jaw to be located at the back and upsets the balance between the palate and tooth.
Drawing attention to the fact that a more complex treatment process may be experienced at 6-7 years of age when permanent teeth start to grow if an early solution is not found, Associate Prof. Dr. Giray said, "We can protect our children from closure and joint problems before the development of the jaw is complete."
A new push for near vision treatment: Trifocal Lenses
Multifocal lenses have already been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients.
The difference of trifocal lenses from other lenses is their ability to provide clear vision at not only long or close distances but also in distances that can be defined as intermediary distances.
The treatment of long, close or intermediary distance vision disorders
Intermediary distance in vision disorders represents a point we frequently use in our daily life.
Thanks also to the correction of intermediary distances by trifocal lenses, our patients do not need to use glasses under any circumstances, whether close or long.
Another advantage provided by trifocal lenses is that they reduce nighttime complaints.
Optometrist Assistant Prof. Dr. Volkan H√ºrmeri√ß said, "Applied for all distance vision treatments, trifocal lens treatment has no difference from normal cataract treatment."
And our patients can return to their normal life the next day.
You can consult an optometrist to learn whether this procedure, which can be applied to all patients over 18 years old, is also appropriate for you or not.
Varicose veins are not used in heart operations!
Varicose is a disease which is increasing in frequency in recent years.
Here are the answers to these questions.
1. In the leg, there is a vein system that we call the main path which carries venous blood to the lungs and collects the main venous blood of the leg.
These are named the deep femoral vein and superficial femoral vein.
These problems in the veins are seen less often, the vessel cannot be closed during illness and medical treatment is applied to keep these veins open.
In the leg, there is a superficial vein system which we refer to as the lateral pathway that carries venous blood to the lungs and integrates with the deep vein system in the groin.
Deficiency and varicose grow in all of these four vessels.
A lack of these vessels does not cause any harm to the body and for this reason, they can be used in heart operations.
However, the vessels should be healthy for these vessels to be used in a heart operation.
Because the heart is a vital organ.
The operation of removing varicose veins or burning with a laser by leaving them in place via an operation reduces the workload of deep veins and ensures that the leg is healthier.
Varicose veins are never ever used in heart operations!
There are other vessels that can be used in heart operations.
Radiology Specialist Dr. Rengin T√ºrkg√ºler
Here are the words with which Dursun √ñzbek drew attention to the unity and solidarity in Turkish football:
This match is neither the first nor the last match in a competition where two more outstanding clubs are left behind.

We lost martyrs.
We have many veterans.

Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
There's no better way to win it.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
You get to win it with your mates.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a league unto itself.
The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.
With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 of last year's 832-page tome as advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that, in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.

They were inspired by Bordum and made a 'model village' in Sivas
Under the G√∂lova district of Sƒ∞VAS, Cank√∂y was made a 'model village' by the District governorship and a benefactor businessman.
In the village where the streets were asphalted and paving stones were laid on the pavements, all the houses were painted in blue and white colors, taking the Bodrum District of Muƒüla as a model.
Village roads, in which infrastructure and superstructure services were increased, were asphalted and its pavements were covered with paving stones.
BODRUM WAS TAKEN AS A MODEL
When we went to Bodrum, the view of the houses painted white with blue windows came to our attention.
With this work, Cank√∂y in Sivas looks like a little Bodrum.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and the support of our businessmen.

Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," according to one of the companies that makes that software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.
Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
