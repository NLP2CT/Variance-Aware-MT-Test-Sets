28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
Over the past six years, the state-owned rail operator has invested over 31 billion Czech crowns in the upgrade of train carriages.
Save for 2012, the annual amounts spent on modernisation have been steadily decreasing.
However, upgraded older carriages are counted towards the indicator as brand new.
Conventional trains consisting of carriages and hauled by locomotives are gradually disappearing from railways not only in the Czech Republic but worldwide and replaced by motorised or electric-powered units.
From January to July, the operator has had 110 of these carriages scrapped.
The rolling stock investment of ČD includes, for example, the purchase of 50 carriages for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the operator plans to use on the line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a master agreement for the purchase of electric-powered units for domestic express railway links.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for several months but they seem powerless to stop it.
The authorities themselves admitted as much.
The editorial staff of the online news provider Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now woos motorists to visit Lipno to take a stroll among the treetops or through the Olympic park.
The motorway operators know that it is there illegally, but claim there is nothing they can do about it.
The Road and Motorway Directorate admitted a few months ago that there was an illegal billboard on their property near the busy national road between České Budějovice and the Lipno dam.
It seems as if nobody cared that it was standing right next to the road, in the fifty-metre protection zone, which must be kept free for safety reasons.
An option would be simply to load in onto a truck and take it away.
"This is not something we can just go ahead and do" said the spokeswoman of the Road and Motorway Directorate, Nina Ledvinová referring to a complex bureaucratic process which must be followed before the billboard can be removed.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial staff found dozens of similar portable adverts located illegally alongside the road or in its close proximity.
"We find it difficult to force companies to remove the billboards," said the head of the transport department of the regional authority in České Budějovice Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are handling similar cases.
The bosses of the companies are often impossible to get hold of or they use the trick, Aktuálně.cz already reported on when they looked into the matter: move the portable stand with advert just a few metres away and the order to remove the illegal billboard is not worth the paper it is written on.
For example, the billboard promoting Lipno is owned by Commerz Billboard.
This concerns a number of adverts placed illegally within the protection zone of a class 1 road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, said Jaroslav Mráz, said the head of the transport department of the municipality of České Budějovice.
The company does not collect its mail and it has closed its official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard rents space from Comerz Billboard and offers it to advertisers, has, however, denied having any connection to it.
Yet this spring, when the Road and Motorway Directorate started to look into the Lipno billboard case at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had the government officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his guest house, where the company is said to have its new address.
The motorway operators have not had any luck with contacting the company at this address either.
The bailiff returned the case, the billboards were still there, maybe in other locations.
It is like fighting windmills, admitted one of the officials on condition of anonymity.
Aktuálně.cz spoke with several MPs, who have shown interest in the problem,
In contrast, there are now MPs, who want to extend the period for keeping the billboards next to major Czech roads.
The government has rejected it.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower compared to last year.
In contrast, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy is expected to increase by 3.9 and 2.5 percent, respectively.
Farmers are expected to harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
This follows from the estimate as at 15 July, released by the Czech Statistical Office.
Last year's harvest of cereals was above average.
This year's harvest exceeds the average for the last five to ten years.
In contrast, the harvest of rapeseed and the poppy is expected to be higher this year.
Czech Statistical Office projects roughly a one-fifth decline in spring barley, which is mainly used in the production of beer.
This is attributable to a 15.2 percent reduction in planted areas and a lower per hectare yield.
In contrast, the harvest of winter barley is estimated to grow by 6.3 percent.
The rye harvest is also expected to be higher year-on-year.
The area planted with poppy seed has also increased over the past four years
Thanks to the increase in sown areas, this year's poppy harvest is expected to be a success.
It will increase compared to last year by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons.
"Although the victim tried to escape, he suffered stabbing and cutting wounds which required hospital treatment and further rehabilitation," said the police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková.
The police arrested two men detained on suspicion of attacking a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete in the centre of Olomouc.
Detectives arrested a thirty four-year-old man from Slovakia and a thirty-seven-year-old man from Olomouc on suspicion of attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
Two of the foreign attackers received a suspended sentence.
We have identified these properties in the city centre with the help of the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
The number of empty buildings in the Czech Republic exceeds the number of homeless people.

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
There was the handshake, yes.
I lost count.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
There is also an economic motive.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm relieved and very humble.
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement.
I regret that it occurred," he said in a statement.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.

He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.

They were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
Judge refuses to deal with the case because of Tluchoř's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who have been accused by the prosecution service of taking bribes in the form of lucrative positions from the then Prime Minister Nečas and his former chief of staff Jana Nagyova in return for a political concession.
Following the intervention of the Supreme Court, Tluchoř is now acting as a witness in the case.
Still, the Judge Helena Králová (editor's note: Ms Králová is a judge for criminal matters) want to be careful to prevent any possible objections.
The case will, therefore, be likely handled by a different judicial district in Prague.
for the alleged misuse of military intelligence to surveil the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas.
According to the lawyer, Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary knee-jerk reaction.
I think that the principle of impartiality should not be interpreted in a way that would exclude a court if a witness's spouse or relative works at the courthouse.
"I find it completely over the top," he added.
According to his lawyer, Petr Toman, a potential objection may have a chance to succeed.
Ms Tluchořová was meant to judge statements about Peroutka.
The wife of the former MP was, for example, scheduled to judge a case involving the statements of the Czech President, Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said about him that he was a Hitler sympathiser.
The girl appears to have died in an air strike of the allied forces.
The schoolgirl travelled to Syria with her two same-aged friends in February last year from London's Gatwick Airport.
The UK Home Office has not commented on the report of her death.
According to the media, Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana went to Syria to join their former schoolfriend from London's Bethnal Green Academy.
The case has received considerable attention and led to tension in relations between the UK and Turkey.
The UK's security services estimate that around 600 British Muslims, including some 50 young women and girls have travelled to Syria so far.
Many of them have joined the IS militants and other groups.
Those who return home present a terrorist threat to the UK.

UN has sharply criticised Bulgaria for criminalising refugees.
Mr Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concerns about Bulgaria's lack of respect for international law," warned Mr Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
He pointed out that "it is particularly worrying to witness how important and influential public figures have publicly expressed support for armed criminal outfits that brazenly organise refugee-hunting patrols along the Bulgarian-Turkish border."
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised, despite the fact that under international law, everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
This year, Bulgaria arrested 14,000 migrants, last year over the same period, it was 21,000.
Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).
Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
So how does it work?
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
So what?
A breakthrough has occurred.

Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Brilliant all over.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
It's not a coincidence.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He's walking with help, and riding a bike.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."
And she still doesn't really know.
It gets better.
You know it will get better for you.
Heavy rain, flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected over the state through Saturday.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.
Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
I just can't believe it.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
This is powerful.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.
Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.

Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.
The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
All the way along his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth.
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
By comparison, freshly washed hands should come in under 60.
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
There's nothing more dirty than that!
Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
Naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low
This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.
Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds.
The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.
He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.
Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility
One-half of the funeral services is not complying with regulations.
One-half of funeral service providers do not comply with laws and regulations.
This is the result of checks carried out by the Czech Trade Inspectorate (CTI) in the second quarter,
in which it established that one of their most common shortcomings is that they fail to inform relatives about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
According to its spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, CTI imposed 41 fines totalling 73,000 Czech crowns
Inspectors discovered deficiencies in 47 of a total of 95 controls.
Besides the failure to inform about prices and issue confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices that differed from those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and in one case an officially unverified measuring instrument was used.
As a result, the Inspectorate banned the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 Czech crowns,
"Given that this is an area of services where laws and regulations are being breached on a regular basis, these checks will continue into the next quarter of the year," said Fröhlich.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIL killed in Syria
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
According to YouGov, the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item, but by midlife nostalgia.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."
While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain.
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I suppose I am," he says.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
That may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?
It's an easy way to occupy your headspace.
"We're like their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.
That's younger people, not older ones, late teens who are just getting into it.
While the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop, rather than noodling jazz, is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
It costs a lot.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
It is pure "art vinyl."
But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.
They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
"Since March, I was able to train normally," he said at the start of summer training having worked his way to full strength.
What was wrong with you?
Then the clot moved upwards.
In the evening, I vomited blood.
I already started picturing myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with it?
Everything is fine now.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I am excited - the team looks strong, and I know most of the guys.
It had a reputation of being an underdog, but every season is different.
Two years ago, Brno was eighth, and now it finished second.
What we make of it is up to us.
Is the manager, Mr Brom a guarantee for success?
He will move us up in the rankings.
Where do you come in?
What does he look like?
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he is a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze are also expected to join.
Do you know anything about them?
How are you looking forward to being the number one setter?
Since then, we climbed up the rankings and I played all the time.
The short individual medley remains Phelps' domain.
I am experiencing an incredible week at the end of my career.
Following in the footsteps of Alu Oerter (discus throw) and Carl Lewis (long jump), Michael Phelps becomes the third athlete in Olympic history to win four consecutive individual titles in the same event.
Shortly after the medal presentation ceremony for the individual medley he advanced into the 100m butterfly final.
In the final, he took gold over Mitch Larkin of Australia, who finished 0.37 seconds behind him and Russia's Evgeny Rylov, who came in third.
While Murphy only finished fifth in 200m backstroke at last year's World Championships, he became the undisputed backstroke king at the Rio Olympics.
American Simone Manuel and Canada's Penny Oleksiak claimed joint gold in the women's 100m freestyle final.
Third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who also won gold in 100m butterfly in a world record time and silver in 200m freestyle.
The world record holder, Australia's Cate Cambell only finished sixth.
Japan's Rie Kaneto won the women's 200m breaststroke. It is the first Olympic medal for the twenty seven-year-old.
I feel very tired, said the Russian swimmer.
They only found out less than an hour before the match who they will be playing against.
They had to master the tactical preparation at a lighting speed.
And then, in an unusual time, the match started on the small court number 1.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermannová said.
We lost that set, which was crucial.
How did you like playing on the small court number 1?
This was quite a change compared with the centre court.
Russia's Birlova blocks a ball in the preliminary round play-off at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková a Barbora Hermannová embrace during the preliminary round play-off at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
How do you rate your Olympic experience?
but now, after the match I am sad.
I'll sleep on it and from tomorrow, I will only remember the positive aspects of the Olympic tournament.
According to the Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith there will be no exceptions.
The Thai national telecoms regulator presented the plan to sell SIM cards specifically designed for foreigners in early August.
It will not be possible to disable this function.
"We do not need this feature for SIM cards sold to Thais because we can always easily track them," added Tantasith.
The seller requires a proof of identity.
These were completely anonymous.
The planned measures do not mean, however, that foreigners are under any obligation to purchase SIM from a local operator upon arrival to the country.
they know the telephone number, but not the owner information.
The authorities' efforts to track the movements of foreigners, have been the subject of sharp criticism by expat groups living in Thailand.
Tantasith has tried to calm the situation with respect to privacy protection by comparing this with the obligation to provide information about the residential address in immigration documents.
"It would be a criminal offence for a service provider to track the SIM location without a court order," added Tantasith.
Luxury flat in a new development in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace.
Why did not choose them?
The second level is the actual interior design: designers have a much better idea about the range of available materials, and they are able to make it all work based on the wishes of the client.
We wanted a generous entertaining-living space with adequate facilities for a family of four, conceived as a modern yet not impersonal interior.
Did you leave everything to the experts or did you have a say in the final look of the interior?
The combination of black, white and nutwood was the brainchild of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, flooring, lighting, carpets, fabrics, art, etc. We then used visualisations to make sure everything worked well together.

The interior is dominated by wood surfaces complemented by leather used e.g. on dining chairs and bar stools Norma from Arper.
How would you characterise the interior?
Perhaps the only complaint concerns the nutwood flooring which is too susceptible to damage in a household with a dog.
to channel natural light to the darker areas of the flat.
Direct access from the master bathroom to the roof terrace and the swimming pool from USSPA is one of the adjustments, which was very beneficial for the functionality of the apartment as a whole.
It also includes a swimming pool and a hot tub.
You are not as negative as the French, says a Muslim living in Prague.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
It is interesting that you mention negativity.
But I had enough.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbour started to look down on me just because I am a Muslim.
As a result, I no longer felt welcome in France,
So you decided to move to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I knew something about the Czech Republic as my dad told me about what happened in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague.
Mainly because of the different atmosphere.
I feel I can do anything, dress in any way I like, and nobody will judge me.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
In the south, everybody is hugging and kissing each other on the cheek.
Does the language barrier present a problem for you?
I would like to learn Czech, but I do not have time
By and large, I did not.
I can think of one experience though.
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen here in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
Until recently, I could not imagine that something like that could happen in France.
It is tough.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I should not feel like that at all.
We met on náměstí Jiřího z Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims, along with Christians demonstrated here against violence.
Did you know about it?
No, I was not aware of it.
Why should they feel guilty for something they did not cause?
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate position of women.
What do you think about it?
Quite the contrary.
and wear a hijab for example?
She prays five times a day, but she does not wear a headscarf.
Do you plan to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I thought for a while about Poland, but I feel great in Prague.
I could even imagine raising my children here.

In the Laser Radial Class, she moved to the tenth place before the final two heats.
This would guarantee the Czech yachtswoman a place in the final.
You can collect parcels like Pokémon.
They want to compete with delivery services.
The brains behind the idea to use already scheduled journeys to transport packages are the TV director Matěj Liška and Marek Greger, a manager of a music club in Prague.
At this point, it contains one thousand cities, and we will continue to expand the network.
We want to learn the business in the Czech Republic first before we start focusing more on other countries, said the forty one-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the app "Převezu" work and who can benefit from it?
You can download the app for free and register.
Have you not dealt with such a case yet?
Is there not a risk that the sender may have to wait too long?
Should traditional carriers worry about potentially losing customers in the future?
We hope that this will be the case.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
In 2014, they started to prepare the application Shippansee LTD, which uses previously scheduled routes between world capitals, in particular, by air to transport packages.
It is a localised version of the Shippansee app adapted to the Czech market.
They have been developing the apps "Mesíkem" and "Mesíkem Profi" since January this year and made them available to users at the end of July 2016.
They intended from the very start to merge all these apps into one.
The sender will save money and the courier will lower the cost of his journey.
This is the powerful idea that connects the two sides.
These are channels that lend credibility to the service and its users.
Couriers also collect stars based on the sender reviews.
We will also be offering insurance, the details of which are currently being fine-tuned.
Couriers set their prices, and they receive the full amount they ask for.
The sender will be charged a few percentage points extra for arranging the contact between the two sides.
Are there any restrictions
You can transport anything.
Senders are not even required to package the item, if they do not wish to hide the package content.
All you have to do is hand the forgotten sweatshirt to the courier.
A friend came up with the idea more than two years ago, and I did not pay much attention to it back then.
Nevertheless, this is not an area you are now focusing on as a matter of priority.
Shippansee LTD was the first and the most expensive app; the other two were in a way just an upgrade.
It works for the sender the same way as "Převezu", the difference being that as a courier, you see the consignments as dots on the map which are the closest to you thanks to GPS on their mobile phone.
The story-scope of Titanfall 2 is expected to deliver nearly forgotten diversity.
Players can enjoy the freedom of movement, which next to running includes the option to use a fighting Titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game contains levels focused on flexibility in movement.
There will also be maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
The pace of the gameplay should, therefore, move between fierce action and quieter moments to explore the unknown planet.
Players will be in control of a foot soldier Jack Cooper, who is dreaming about becoming a professional pilot.
Important will also be the conversations Cooper has with the Titan.
The Polygon server was first to report on the Titanfall 2 campaign.
Titanfall 2 will be released on 28 October for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to Nordic THQ.
Following the collapse of the publishing house THQ, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the company name and logo.
As a result, Nordic was able to release e.g. Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or the Red Faction Collection.
He was quite a big guy, probably her type as she dated a similar type before me.
Later, I figured out that they were meeting in the house where he lived, in the laundry room.
And I actually did it.
At the time, I also bumped into his wife on her way from the shops.
Hence, I was not really contemplating a divorce.
I told myself that I would forgive her everything and life would go on.
This is not how it went down,
I am still keeping those feelings inside.
the only difference being that she is more of a housekeeper than my wife.
She always did everything at home - she did the cooking, washing, cleaning up.
She has always been a hard worker.
Sometimes I would like to touch and hug her but she would not let me.
I am tired of such a life.
with the objective to make the financial flows between mosques and countries that that fund their construction more transparent.
"It is a total failure," said Valls recently.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by Jean-Pierre Chevènement, the former minister of interior and defence, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are roughly 2,500 mosques and places of worship in France, of which some 120 are thought to be under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 of Imams and dozens are currently under consideration.
One of them operated a facility which was reportedly radicalising believers who later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
"We have shut down twenty mosques since December and other will follow," said the Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
Zaragoza.
The shooting took place after the woman and her daughter left a garage in their car.
The woman was taken to the hospital by her uninjured daughter, while the man in critical condition was taken there by ambulance.
The shooting took place at around 11:00 local time in the centre of the capital of the autonomous region of Aragon, not far from the local university.
The Independent is citing the Spanish news agency Europa Press, according to which the motive was likely related to unresolved issues surrounding the couple's recent divorce.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame seaweed, ginger and chilli sauce.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, except perhaps for a salad or roasted vegetables here and there.
This also applies to the even easier rice paper rolls from today's recipe,
which allows you to skip the more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The advantage of Asian cuisine these days is that the ingredients are today readily available.
Including the pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic accompaniments for fresh sushi or rolls.
Banana leaves.
They are used primarily in Buddhist and Hindu cultures when serving and decorating dishes for a variety of ceremonial occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are widespread in many countries in Asia and South America as tools to prepare a variety of baked, boiled or fried foods, which are packed into them like in an aluminium foil.
Banana leaves also lend food a specific flavour.
Only choose leaves that are bright green and healthy, i.e. without cracks and spots
The preparation of a salad made from wakame seaweed, sesame and sesame oil is similarly straight forward.
Wakame − the dark green seaweed growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido − can be eaten fresh or dried and is as popular as nori.
Dried and shredded wakame is also used as a spice for seasoning rice, for example.
Next, they cool it in ice water, cut out the centre ribbing and processed further to prepare e.g. this popular salad.
All that remains is to prepare a roll with a simple vegetable filling, which is both delicious and light and full of healthy flavours.
Asians know how to do this.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots 40 g white radish, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g cucumber 60 g wakame seaweed and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
Handful of chopped coriander, teaspoon black sesame, teaspoon sriracha chili sauce, 20 g mango and 40 g pickled gari ginger, a few pine nuts.
First, we will prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper for five seconds in the cold water.
Next, take it out and wait until it softens.
We place the vegetable filling on the softened paper and wrap it.
We will prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and cucumber, cut into fine strips, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped coriander, mix it thoroughly and add to the rice paper.
We place the asparagus tips on the banana leaf, add the rolls and garnish the dish with wakame seaweed, pickled ginger, a slice of mango and we sprinkle black sesame and pine nuts on the top.
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.
On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
It alters your outlook a bit.
It was an incentive.
That's how it starts off.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's really important not to get carried away.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.

Prison?
I would prefer if they had to drive people for free, says the taxi mafia hunter Rubeš in connection with the ground-breaking prosecution.
I am mainly curious about the verdict,
That is useless.
This is a somewhat strange solution.
Do you think this is an adequate tariff?
I have a problem with custodial sentences in general.
I cannot think of a better form of punishment.
It would work like a community service.
They will find another way how to defraud others.
He has previously filmed shows with titles "Jak na to" [What to do], "Město podvodů?" [City of fraud?], "Život v luxusu" [Life in luxury], "A dost!" [Enough!] and "Praha vs. Prachy" [Prague vs money]. VUTIUM a Prometheus, Brno a Praha 2001. Fast cash
In the indictment, they are referred to as an organised group.
Can this group of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as a mafia-style group?
This is more about mobsters-juniors, but they are definitely organised.
I am talking about Aleš Ryjáček, for example.
The police has not detained him for some reason.
They only picked a few people from that large group.
Yes.
The business of the Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Still, some of them, even if it is only a small minority, will end up in court.
This is a breakthrough.
A similar case.
You spoke about the trick with the decimal point, which the fraudsters use to scam foreign customers.
It is my experience that the fair taxi drivers are thankfully in the majority.
Do they want to push back against those who are damaging the reputation of their services?
There is a will, but they lack the skills.
When they staged the demonstration (because of blanket restrictions proposed by the office of the Mayor of Prague Adriana Krnáčová), they did not come across as if they knew exactly what they wanted.
On the one hand, they claimed that their protest was not against Uber, that they only want the same conditions as Uber does, on the other they said they wanted more than Uber.
How do you rate overall the approach of the Prague Magistrate to the issue of fare overcharging?
What was the response?
especially those infamous Prague celebrities.
My last question is clear.
Bém disguised as an Italian tourist.
The taxi driver charged him 820 Czech crowns for a journey from Staroměstské to Václavské náměstí, which roughly translates to 195 crowns per kilometre as the documentary makers discovered.
The Prague Magistrate has set the maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometre.
They charge up to 600 crowns for a 2.5 kilometre ride to Anděl.
Marble is mainly cleaned with clean water, avoiding chemicals as much as possible and the longer the better.
"A restorer has to be diligent, patient and not too demanding with respect to the working conditions," she said.
This is by far not her first restoration work in the Frýdlant region.
She was behind the restoration of the stone elements of the façade in the rear wing of the Frýdlant Town Hall, the statue of St. Mary Magdalene in , Zátiší, the statue of St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Pieta in Okružní ulice in Frýdlant, Marian Column in Frýdlant or Atlanta in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
There are hundreds of years old, and they are remnants of the gravestone decoration.
It was richly decorated, but unfortunately after the raid by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, it all disappeared.
The church is otherwise in a very good condition as we invest every year in its repairs and maintenance.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from the regional round of the competition "Historic city of 2015", the balance of 28 thousand crowns will be contributed by the Ministry of Culture, said the Mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The views of experts on the future performance of selected foreign markets tracked by indices compared with the Czech capital market (PX) over a horizon of one month and half a year.
The US-based S&P 500, which went through a 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high, and it has gained another 7% since the start of the year.
In a situation where US stocks are trading at their all-time highs, volatility is again decreasing. Volatility is currently at its lowest since 2014, when markets were growing thanks to the quantitative easing programme of the Federal Reserve and the volatility index (VIX) held steady below 12 percent.
Although the Federal Reserve keeps preparing the markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and in Japan is still in full swing, and in the past week, the Bank of England also joined the party by committing to buy bonds worth 60 billion pounds over a period of six months.
How long will this party last?
There are currently no risks in sight, the world economy is going through a period of almost constant growth without any major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity markets and in China is stabilising and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we should not be surprised if US shares continued in this relatively calm mode going forward.
I am very happy that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said the European Commission President, Juncker, when he appointed the French politician (who is indeed experienced having held so many different supranational political functions that it would be hard to find a better example of so-called European elites) to be the chief Brexit negotiator for the European Commission.
and he hates the UK.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) he was in charge of reforming the European banking law.
It would be to the greater benefit of all of us!
The Kremlin leader dismissed his close ally and confidant Ivanov.
This was reported by the Russian media, citing a press release put out by Kremlin's press office.
At the same time, he announced that Mr Ivanov had been appointed Special Presidential Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport.
The news of the replacement at the top of the president's office has come as a surprise. Ivanov will be replaced by his former deputy, Vajno.
Neither Kvitová nor the double act of Strýcová and Šafářová will be playing in the finals.
None of Friday's matches have so far been successfully converted into a place in the final.
They then proceeded to lose the second set 4:6.
Czech rowing recorded some success during the morning programme in Rio: Ondřej Synek won his semifinal in single sculls by beating Chroatia's Damir Martin almost by a second despite easing a bit at the end of the race.
In contrast, his opponents had to fight,
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not follow in Synek's footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old rower came in fourth in her semifinal and on Saturday, she will start in the B finals, where she will fight for seventh to twelfth place.
She fought until the end believing that she will reach the elite six in her fourth consecutive games.
She only gave up shortly before the finish line.
I was surprised by the Chinese rower and her strong finish.
event in which he finished 33rd.
The Russian team performed best in the qualification.
In comparison, Nepejchal only scored 620.5 points.
The first track and field athletes have started their campaigns, among them the Czech heptathletes Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who cleared 1.98 cm in the high jump, and Belgium's Nafissatou Thiam are currently in the lead.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed to the 94 millions of victims of communism, as recorded in the Black Book Of Communism, whether this was related to everyday individual repressions, targeted famine, incompetent warfare or inhuman experiments.
Both Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities in the occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany or the USSR, it was not only a few individuals who were guilty of these atrocities. Large sways of population took part in these crimes, whether actively or passively as a result of cowardice or putting their heads in the sand.
This was not only exclusive to these two nations, we Czechs are also guilty.
In Germany, the process of denazification started in the immediate aftermath of the war, followed by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
The most important thing, however, came later.
How could you!
It brought real reflection and healing to the society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, elimination of poverty and welfare of the country's citizens.
There was no period of reflection in Russia after they lost the cold war.
The window of opportunity to make any positive changes has definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when the former KGB (sic!) officer Vladimir Putin came to power.
Beat your own and others will be afraid.
The Ukrainian army.
After a long period of relative calm the relations between Ukraine and Russia have dropped to a new low.
The pretext for the Ukrainian side was the Crimean peninsula, which has been annexed by Russia more than two years ago, and it is now part of its territory.
The simple answer is: they would not.
The Ukrainian leadership has lost all credit, as the approval rating of President Poroshenko hovers around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have gone bankrupt a long ago if it were not for the generous funding from the EU and the IMF.
Bulgaria Posts Inflation for 1st Time in 8 Months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, national statistics show.
This is the highest value in years (since June 2012) and the first one above zero since October of last year when a positive 0.2% was posted.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
It is alleged that two Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack.
The new Advisory Board for Cyber Security
The acting head of the Democratic Party Donna Brazile on Thursday announced that she was setting up an Advisory Board for Cyber Security to "prevent future attacks and to ensure first-class protection of the servers of the Democratic Party."
The chain apologised.
Based on the health complaint from a consumer after eating the Wild Smoked Salmon- pieces 100 g, with the use-by date of 22.11.2016, the Prague hygienists carried out inspections of the Albert stores at Václavské náměstí and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that batch L23012562/T4 with a use-by date of 22.11.2016, the customer complained about was no longer available and sample was therefore taken from a product from the same batch with a use-by date of 11.12.2016.
Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp., Anisakis simplex.
We are very sorry about the problem with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale, and we have also withdrawn all other batches of this product as a matter of precaution.
The seller was Nekton-Vrňata.
According to the server bezpecnostpotravin.cz, people can suffer from anisakiasis as a result of ingesting the parasite. The symptoms include stomach pains, vomiting and nausea, but some patients do not have any symptoms at all, said ČTK.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract of the host.
The veterinary service has inspected the salmon at the premises of the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Bohemia.
Three of the five examined samples tested positive for the parasite.
According to the State Veterinary Service (SVS), the shipment containing 1700 products came to the Czech Republic at the beginning of April.
After the initial excitement and quick marriage to a jihadist, who was soon killed, came the sobering.
The girl was, according to relatives, in touch with her sister Halima.
The family communicated with her from their flat in East London.
They discussed how she could leave Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There hoped to reunite with the former student there.
They said at home that they were only going out.
This was not possible without risking that they will get caught, the lawyer added.
As their families have not received any communications from them for some time now they have to brace themselves that they are most likely dead.
The town representatives, therefore, decided to move the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848. It was much more prisoner-friendly as it was heated and lit by gas.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says
The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
"I have no clue," she said.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.
We've made a complete turnaround.
The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.
So is Bam.
Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
Mr. Dooley, a first-time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making, may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time, buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.
But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The trampoliner's vector is up.
Forward motion is not the goal.
The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.
"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.
Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to crack?
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
The government response, according to human rights groups, was ruthless.
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip.
But that may be changing.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle along that jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
"That," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very tight rope to walk."
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
The post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
The coffee is still good, too.
It even reused the lights from the old Verb.
He introduced new ingredients.
There are brown-rice bowls.
After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked," she said.
He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we still might take them up on it," Mr. Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other perks.
For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.
"I've needed to smell that," he said.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
He was fabulously out of touch.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is how TV shows would look like if we were making them.
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.
Chilli-powder condoms, firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
The method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals.
Previously many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?

The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.

Trade between Russia & Iran surges 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to get access to the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
They finished in 3:51.943.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.
A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue.
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.
With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 of last year's 832-page tome as advertising content).
Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she photographed to LOVE magazine.
And, in her downtime, possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids, she's on reality television.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.
But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
She died at the scene.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
the Executive Director of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková said on Friday.
Last year the event attracted about 35,000 people.
We are also holding the first Pride Tourism Symposium as part of the festival.
The highlight of the festival will be the traditional parade featuring floats, from Václavské náměstí to Letná.
Over the past few years, thousands of people took part in the parade, which will hold one-minute silence this year in honour of the victims of the June attack at the nightclub in Orlando, where an attacker shot and killed 49 people, mostly gay men.
Pat and Mat turn forty this year.
The pilot episode of the children's bedtime TV show premiered on 12 August 1976.
The animated TV series, which has been aired in more than hundred countries around the world, was inspired by the cartoons about two handymen Mr Ouholíček and Mr Sedlec, which the artist and the series director Lubomír Beneš created for a magazine.
Lubomír Beneš then invited the dramaturg Jiri Kubicek and fellow artist Vladimír Jiránek to work with him and together they created the short film entitled Kuťáci (The Tinkers).
They only got their current look featuring their signature yellow and red jumpers, beanie hat and a beret in 1979 when the authors started work on a new series for Slovak television at Krátký film studios in Prague.
There are currently over ninety episodes with these clumsy handymen who are always good-natured and full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm despite their mishaps. They are always happy with the results of their work, which they by making a signature and "...a je to!" ["...and it's done!"].
A fairy tale for Fiji and the two-year-old Harmony.
Both have a good ending.
So let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
This is a Friday overview from the world's websites.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
The island state of Fiji is celebrating a historical success.
Fiji's rugby team defeated in the final of the Olympic sevens rugby tournament the team of Great Britain.
This is the first Olympic gold medal ever won by Fiji.
"Let's play freely and lightly and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," said the manager before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated the match, and the small island state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale,
as reported by the French daily Le Monde.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who lost all her limbs when she was 11 months old has a new friend.

Rowing supremos.
We are just going to win, Murray and Bond said laughing.
The rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have dominated men's coxless pairs for seven years, and they reiterated their dominance at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
In Thursday's finale they have recorded their 69th win in a row on the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon.
We are simply better looking, joked Murray during the Olympic regatta when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Honestly, we don't do a hell of a lot differently.
We train hard, really hard,
Their domination is also remarkable given their different physique.
This is likely the reason why they do not spend much time together outside rowing.
We are just going to win.
We race on a two kilometre stretch of water, and we never want to test our limits during the first kilometre of the race.
We know what we have to do to win, said the thirty-four-year-old Murray.
Together with his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
Following an unexpected defeat of the bigger crew at the Beijing Olympics, Murray and Bond decided to break out into a pair.
This time it was more enjoyable.
We know that everyone wants to knock us from our number one position.
We walk around with the target on our backs.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not register, there would not be a qualification agreement. Does this mean that I could move to a different hospital after a few months?
I am asking because there is an opening in the field I would like to work in. The only problem is that the hospital is far away. There may be another opening in six months in a hospital much closer to me where I would like to work.
You are not required under any law to sign a qualification agreement with an employer - hospital.
Act No 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions of obtaining and recognizing professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the medical profession of doctor, dentist, pharmacist, as amended, specifically states that participation in specialised training is considered to be an enhancement of qualification (rather than an upgrade).
This means that under the Labour Code, a qualification agreement can only be concluded if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
The law only stipulates the application requirements for being included in specialisation training.
The law foresees a situation where professional experience in another field of specialisation can count towards specialised medical training of the doctor in question, if its content and scope relate to the relevant educational programme.
Given that I do not know the details of this case, I would recommend a consultation with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (department of science and medical professions), because the Ministry of Health is required by law to provide advisory and consultancy services relating to the specialist training and its structure.
"We have seen no effort on behalf of the United States to lift the siege (of the rebel-held part of the city by government forces) or even use its influence to push the parties to protect civilians," said the letter addressed to the White House according to the AFP news agency.
"We do not need tears or sympathy or even prayers; what we desperately need is a no-fly zone over eastern Aleppo to stop the attacks, and we need international action to prevent Aleppo from being again surrounded," said the doctor.
Russian forces which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, announced that from today, military hostilities in Aleppo will stop for three hours every day to allow humanitarian convoys safe passage.
All military activity, including air strikes and artillery fire is supposed to stop from 9:00 to 12:00 CEST.
The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Stephen O'Brien welcomed the initiative, but stressed that what is needed is at least a two-day truce.
The world has stood by and remarked how complicated Syria was, while doing little to protect us.
Gasping for air, their lives ended before they had really begun.
In recent weeks, forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad supported by Russian forces have seized control of the rebel-held east Aleppo with over 200,000 people still trapped inside with no food supplies.
