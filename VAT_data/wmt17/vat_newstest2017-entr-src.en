28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.

Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
I lost count.
He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.
He's denied that emphatically.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.

Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I would just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing crew, and, most importantly, the best fans that a show could ever hope to have.
The show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September.
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was watching over these guys today.
It is fascinating to see how the world turns.
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
So how does it work?
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels.
Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.
A breakthrough has occurred.
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.

Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks.
In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
I can't do this.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
He's walking with help, and riding a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers, and singing.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."
But it's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.
It came up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.
He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
I just can't believe it.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
This is powerful.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.
This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.

Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'

CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
Thanks for that.
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'

Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian."
They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.

Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives
The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.
He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
London schoolgirl who joined ISIL killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.
She was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
I do this for women.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
But are YouGov's results true?
So, let's take a look.
"I suppose I am," he says.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.
His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint.
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.
More of the product side, less of the music.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
It costs a lot.
I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.
While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.
But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
"I have no clue," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Bam was on that team.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.

"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.
Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia about to crack?
Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.
"If you suffocate people and they don't have any other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
The result, many fear, is more bloodshed.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
But in an early-morning Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.
The post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.
But I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
When a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost, he said he was excited to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
He introduced new ingredients.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.
There are brown-rice bowls.
Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.
He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.
Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well.
The new location has other perks.
A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Previously many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great shame.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
"I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
It was suggested that banks participate in the campaign stage which Emlak Konut started and which GYODER then participated in.

5 OR 10 YEAR OPTION
A large majority of housing loan users choose a 5-10 year term payment schedule.
The interest rate reduction will positively affect sales.
GYODER President Aziz Torun: It should be reduced to less than 9 percent a year
They paid close attention to the appeal by our President and reduced interest rates.
However, this rate should fall to under 9 percent a year.
However, loan interest rates should fall below 9 percent on a yearly basis.
Apart from that, there are a certain number of steps taken towards the revival of the economy in all sectors.
We say to them, come, join this mobilization, walk the same path with us and let's revive the economy together, hand in hand.

Appeal from BDDK: Complain to those banks
When interest rates were 7-8% per annum, banks earned money from these transactions.
Mentioning that if the coup attempt had not occurred the number of Russian tourists to Turkey would have exceeded 1 million, Kızıldağ continued as follows:
We lost one month in the period that we call high season so targets have been downsized.
Even so, I think we will surpass the number of 500 thousand if charter flights start.
I suggest that this positive atmosphere will be well appreciated by Russian people.
With this momentum, I think we can do our best to hopefully reach 700 thousand.
Stating that they feel hopeful for 2017 with regard to the Russian market, Kızıldağ said that if the Russian economy gathers strength along with relations between the two countries, the number of Russian tourists may reach over 3 million again next year.
He said, "We have hopeful expectations for Eid al-Adha."

THEY AGREED ON 2-2.5 MILLION EURO
However, it was stated that Fenerbahçe will reach an agreement for a figure less than this amount.
I think Vitor Pereira will be more than happy to go, our management will be more than good.
My joy stuck in my throat.
Seeing that Pereira is gone, the champions are Fenerbahçe.
Seeing that Pereira is gone, let's now go to Kadıköy on the 18th.

FETO ringleader Gülen's assets were seized
Adana 2. The High Criminal Court then decided in accordance with "article 278/1 of the Law of Criminal Procedures (CMK)" to the seizure of all assets of Fetullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who are abroad in order to ensure that the suit against them remains inconclusive and who have become fugitives as they are not reachable.
Hüseyin Gülerce: Gülen's demise depends on the collapse of 3 stands
The headlines from Hüseyin Gülerce's statements are as follows:
They are real hypocrites.
It is wondered who he is.
The guy went to Pennsylvania 2 times within the last 25 days before the coup attempt, and came back 2 days before.
When you gather them together, this should be investigated; it should be investigated which ones of those who are escapees now went to the USA with an excuse after March 1999 when Fetullah Gülen went to the USA.
It is in the Wikileaks documents; Gülen has a foundation established and this foundation has mutual meetings with the CIA.
However, the bad thing is the following; this information fell to Pennsylvania as well as the CIA.
Gülen's fall depends on the collapse of three stands; one of them constitutes the friendship circle that we call grassroots; there are quite deeply hypnotized ones among them, they are still saying that this coup attempt is an Erdoğan film.
International support still exists.
The only thing to break the political support is authentication of the fact that the tapes of Baykal and MHP managers were taken by FETO.
According to information received, fire commenced by the terrorists using long barreled weapons against the armored car in which there were police who were conducting their patrol duty in the Selahattin Eyyübi Neighborhood.
Two terrorists were neutralized in the clash after the police responded.
Operations are continuing in the region.
Playing an important part in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15, private television stations continued to broadcast thanks to technical personnel in Türksat that heroically resisted the coup plotters.
They held a gun to my head and wanted me to cut the broadcast.
I shut down only local TV.
After that I said that we need to go to the dish antennas to make them move away from the building.
I spent around 20 minutes in the section in which there are antennas.
When the coup plotters could not succeed in cutting the broadcast in Türksat, they brought experts from Samanyolu TV.
Indicating that the coup plotters understood that TV broadcasts were continuing when they came back to the building after a telephone call came to them around 1 hour later and that he had a close brush with death at that time, Akkaya talked about what he experienced as follows:
That night, I took over guard duty at 8 o'clock.
There were several aircraft around the helicopter that made a silent and low altitude flight.
We saw their lights.
Possibly, they were unmanned aerial vehicles that can take pictures.
They were flying in front of the helicopters.
While we were going to the regular army to get information, we learned that all the programs broadcast by TRT were off-air.
TRT broadcasts were cut for 5 minutes.
I called the TRT program controller but I could not reach anyone.
Our control station said that TRT broadcasts came back on-air and the announcement started to be read.
Our Assistant General Director, Halil Yeşilçimen, wanted TRT broadcasts to be immediately cut upon the instruction of the general director.
As TRT 3 did a wide broadcast from the channel, we started to prepare the works to cut the broadcast.
We cut TRT, and after a while we heard the sound of a helicopter.
We went out, the helicopter landed and the army started shooting everywhere, everyone scattered somewhere.
We hid in a building at the back.
We were 12 people in total.
We showed up to stand with them.
At that time, I saw that they caught our general director and brought him to his knees.
Their commanders started to shout, "Who is in charge here, I won't ask again."
That is to say there is a resistance.
At that moment I felt that I gave up on my life.
I said, 'it is me.'
I got to my feet up at that moment not knowing what to do.
At that moment, the only thing I thought is the fact that fire had started from the helicopter towards my friends at the regular army office.
The commander at the head of them said, 'You will cut all broadcasts except TRT.'
There were no national broadcasts among them.
After all, we faced up to the fact that we won't be able to get out from there.
I said, 'OK, I will cut.'
I cut the antenna output of one of the local channel packages.
I cut the power button going to the monitors in which we can watch the national channels.
In this way, it will be written no signal in all the screens.
I said that I needed to go to the antennas to completely cut them.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, one of the soldiers said, "stop there."
He held the gun to my forehead.
He said, 'You will cut all of them except TRT, there will be none remaining, I will shoot one of you sooner or later, it will be you.'
We entered the station and I cut the local broadcasts.
We passed to the other antenna.
They believed the answers we gave.
After leaving the antenna they asked where the transformer was.
It occurred to me that I did not cut the Cyprus broadcasts.
I was thinking about cutting them to stall the soldiers.
They felt relieved because they thought that the broadcasts were cut.
They did not think of looking at the broadcasts.
Then the group proceeded to wait.
When they turned on the TV in the waiting area after about an hour, they saw A Haber broadcasting.
He said, 'My commander, A Haber has not stopped broadcasting.'
He said, 'stand up.'
I stood up.
At that moment one soldier said, 'there are still continuing broadcasts.'
He said, 'there are channels broadcasting in Cyprus.'
I said, 'they are broadcasting through Cyprus, we cannot do anything to them.'
The coup plotters escaped from Türksat by minibus.
I saw from the photos that the soldier who brought me to the toilet and gave me water was killed on the seat of that minibus.
They fired 3 times to his forehead and shot him in his cheeks.
Possibly he was a private soldier that did his military service.
They may have executed him to get rid of him.
They came back after 40 minutes.
When the police squads came they could not see anyone at the Türksat outer security gate.
Dağkapı spirit after Yenikapı
It is thought that HDP will not be invited to the activities in Yenikapı.
God damn the coup plotters.
In fact, I don't even recognize Adil Öksüz, whom I have know for 18 years.
Let him come and trust Turkish justice.
The police department is not dealing with anything else for 20-25 days.
We do not want Turkey to become like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
It has a president like Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
FETO operation at the university: 30 in detention

He saw the conspiracy in Ergenekon, FETO killed him
Ankara Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the role of FETO in the death of Special Operation Department Director, Behçet Oktay, whose case was closed saying, "He committed suicide" in 2009.
He was acquitted at the end of the trial.
In jail because of another crime and having said to have been involved in the death of Oktay by sending a letter to the prosecutor's office, Nurhan Önder was sentenced to 6 months in jail for the crime of "taking the blame and deceiving the legal authorities."
THOSE PROSECUTORS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED
Oktay's family wants the autopsy prosecutor, Nihat Yıldırım, to be investigeted together with these prosecutors.
Saying that it was not possible that Halil Kesici killed specially trained Oktay on his own, the family requested an extension of the investigation.
While all the requests of the family were rejected, it was revealed that Oktay was wiretapped as a Hezbollah Terrorist Organization member with the fake name "Abdurrahman Doğru" 6 days before he died.
FETO IS CERTAINLY BEHIND THIS
Interviewed by SABAH, the Oktay family is hopeful that the current investigation is conducted.
We could not perceive it.
My elder brother said, 'They will eat me' before he was killed.
I did not think of death.
She said, "At that time the management was in their hands."

Because of the heat and friction in the atmosphere, the Perseid shower produces red light when cold and white light when hot in their natural environment.
A contribution can be made by writing how many meteors are seen on the website of the International Meteor Organization.
These data carry valuable information as they are collected from every part of the world.
Explaining that the meteor shower travels at a speed of around 60 km/h, Esenoğlu said that this visual feast in the sky can be well seen from places that receive little light in the northeast direction during the whole night.
The above-written statement is the translation of a sentence in an article published in Foreign Policy last week.
In fact, if the statistics are looked at, the first ten years of Erdoğan's term can be interpreted as a period in which the opposition against the West in Turkey decreased or remained at an average position.
There are many reasons to be counted like the facts that Erdoğan criticized Israel with 'one-minute'; the E.U. could not put forward a clear policy over the outbreak of civil war as a result of the Assad government's massacres, and left Turkey alone in the refugee crisis; Some figures like European Parliament President Schulz showed contemptuous behavior as in the expression "Erdoğan is not our interlocutor"; An offend Erdogan competition was held and was won by the London Mayor at the time and now Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with his poem that includes many unimaginably disgusting swear words; PKK's Syria branch of YPG is glorified in Europe by opening both exhibitions and offices while PKK members that entered from Syria to Turkey became suicide bombers and slaughtered tens of our citizens; US soldiers in Syria wear uniforms with the YPG symbol; its special representative for the struggle against DAESH, Brett McGurk, paid special visits to the YPG; while the opposition groups that don't pose a threat to Turkey, such as the YPG, are left alone, all the intelligence and logistic supports are given to the YPG; Turkey's struggle against DAESH was underestimated and the number of our troops was decreased in Mosul because of Baghdad government oppression and USA support.
Again, Erdoğan still has not even said that he thinks the USA had an impact on the coup...
Was there any viewpoint other than likening Turkey's cities to Syria's cities for those who participated in this movement?
Why does a commissioned officer bomb the parliament of his own country?
We should not have fallen into the error of expecting reasonable behavior from people brainwashed with the maledictions of FETO.
The people who present politics as an occupation of quarreling, grudges, and hatred made the necessary contributions to the tragedies experienced.
The reckless people who present themselves as "enlightened" make the masses believe that all kinds of anomalous behavior, or even impudence, is natural.
Finally, we saw how the people who hate their own people commenced fire against these people when they received a gun.
The way of democracy, the way we know
Behind July 15, there are three periods; 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and after.
There are three changes prepared in these three periods: economic, social and political.
I stated on Wednesday that this movement happened via the metro.
The second biggest change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The contribution of roads and bridges to the modernization is more easily understood.
Demirel built the Bosphorus Bridge.
Even the routes of these roads show the relationship established between the periphery-center.
It was to make them adopt the ideology of the center.
A somewhat closed system was created in those regions.
After 2002, the AK Party acted with the method I stated, politicized the masses, integrated them into the politics and matured them.
That is to say, history and sociology overlapped.
Let me add one more dimension: AK Party's move I mentioned is not limited to İstanbul's bridges.
A more interesting thing happens: Now the AK Party is integrating peripheral cities with central cities.
Add roads to this.
Turkey will reach İzmir from Thrace via another route now.
Do you know what this means? İzmir will become an utterly different city from now on.
Let's say that the AK Party will win İzmir from the 'outside', as it could not win from the 'inside.'
From now on, the cities of Bursa, Çanakkale and Thrace will be transformed into other human and social geographies.
The July 15 martyrs are the stars of this big adventure.
Fenerbahçe continued preparations for the Grapphoppers match with training in the morning.
Training was completed with two goal, small area, matches.
New developments took place regarding the Match-Fixing Operation against Fenerbahçe.
Why did he become obsessed with Aziz Yıldırım?
He expressed, "The Match-fixing case was to eliminate Aziz Yıldırım."
After these words, another explanation came from Faik Işık, who is one of the most important lawyers in the Match-Fixing Case.
Here are the remarks of Faik Işık:
Mr. Aziz is a witty man, he also speaks with stinging expressions when criticizing someone.
These expressions are conveyed to somewhere.
Muharrem Usta: Match-fixing is different
Trabzonspor President Muharrem Usta offered a friendly hand to Fenerbahçe.
We should maintain a strong stance.
The price of sacrificial animals was announced
Karabulut said the following: "We, as the Union, determined the kg price of living sacrificial calves as 18 lira."
Drawing attention to the fact that the animals not to be sacrificed last year were put on sale, Karabulut talked about the things that citizens should look at when buying a sacrificial animal:
It is necessary to pay attention to the ear tag of the animals.
Moreover, it is also very important that the animal is healthy.
To do this, our citizens can check the vaccinations in the animals' passport when buying a sacrificial animal.
We saw that animals that were not sacrificial last year were put on sale and sold.
We understand this by looking at the animal's teeth.
As the cap teeth are bigger than the others, they are immediately noticed.
Rize Airport will be constructed on the sea
Rize Airport will be the second airport to be constructed with a sea embankment.
Rize Airport will be constructed on the sea embankment at a distance of 26 or 32 meters over an area of 266 hectares between Pazar district, Yeşilköy village and Kız Kulesi locality.
As the depth in the Rize airport construction is too much, filling material will be used at 3 times more than that used in the Ordu-Giresun airport.
Rize Airport, which will serve passenger and cargo planes in general, is expected to also serve planes which have a composition class D, heavy turbulence class and more than 150 thousand kilogram take-off weight.
In the first step, the sea embankment, runway, apron, taxiway, orbit road, safety wire fence, jetty, and the environmental lighting works will be done for the Rize Airport project, which will be put to tender on September 8 by the General Directorate of Infrastructural Investment of the Ministry of Transportation, Maritime Affairs and Communications.
Construction of Rize Airport will be completed in 2 years and 9 months.
Accordingly, the average liter price of diesel fuel in Ankara will rise from 3.68 lira to 3.76 lira.

The prices determined by the distribution companies can vary slightly depending on the companies and cities due to competition and freedom.

Striking expressions from Robert Amsterdam about FETO!
An official from the Amsterdam&Partners law company which juristically investigates the internationally illegal activities of the Fetulllah Terrorist Organization (FETO), Robert Amsterdam shared information with the USA magazine Forbes by writing an article about how FETO is organized.
Amsterdam shared the following opinions in his article:
According to the information we received from the denunciators, the Gülen organization has a rigid hierarchy in which instructions are conveyed.
This group conveys the instructions to the advisory committee.
Stating that the organization opened 55 thousand places of business all over the world and has the widest charter school network, Amsterdam said that millions of dollars are given to these schools from the taxes paid by American taxpayers every year.
Amsterdam wrote that most of this money is directed by the organization members and transferred to the "chosen" subcontracting companies.
Drawing attention to the fact that there are similar situations in Harmony schools, which have 46 branches and occupies the biggest place in the Gülen network, Amsterdam stated that money was paid to the Gülen connected smaller companies for such items as software licenses, receiving of the curriculum.
Indicating that nothing was done to prevent this kind of thing up until now, Amsterdam said that the situation got much worse over the course of time, and upon this, the Texas Education Agency started to investigate the irregularities.
Amsterdam finished his article as follows:
There are question marks in the minds of the policymakers in the USA about July 15-16 and the incidents after that and this is an expected thing.
However, those in state authorities should realize that USA laws are violated serially in Gülen's operations while dealing with the situation of the two allies on the diplomatic level.

Be careful of this children's habit
Faculty of Dentistry Associate Prof. Dr. Bilgin Giray said that children turn sucking into a necessity and relax through this reflex because they cannot chew at an early age.
Explaining the reasons why the thumb sucking habit is seen in children, Associate Prof. Dr. Giray said, "Thumb sucking is a circumstance seen from birth until 3-4 years of age."
Most babies suck their thumb.
Sucking their thumb to satisfy their need of sucking in infancy, children suck their thumb after 1-1,5 years of age to eliminate the mother's breast and to relax.
Thumb sucking has a negative effect on the shaping of the dental structure of the child.
As a result of the pressure that takes place while sucking, the upper teeth are pushed forward and the lower teeth are pushed back.
It causes the lower jaw to be located at the back and upsets the balance between the palate and tooth.
A new push for near vision treatment: Trifocal Lenses
After the treatment of cataracts, patients naturally do not want to use glasses.
Multifocal lenses have already been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients.
The success of the treatment in this area is taken further with trifocal lenses, which started to be used recently.
The treatment of long, close or intermediary distance vision disorders
Intermediary distance in vision disorders represents a point we frequently use in our daily life.
For example, the display panel of cars, portable computers we hold on our lap or the distance we define as 60-70 cm, arm's length, are intermediary distances.
Our patients, to whom we applied trifocal treatment, recover their eye health easily with a 7-10 minute procedure.
And our patients can return to their normal life the next day.
It is an operation that raises the quality of life especially for people who use a car, use a computer a lot, love reading, and have a more active life.
Varicose veins are not used in heart operations!
Varicose is a disease which is increasing in frequency in recent years.
Primarily affected by genetic proximity, long working hours, jobs that require standing for a long period and sitting for a long period have caused an increase in complaints of varicose.
The questions like, "I have varicose, what is done if I have a heart attack in the future?" are frequently asked by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of vein system in the legs:
1. In the leg, there is a vein system that we call the main path which carries venous blood to the lungs and collects the main venous blood of the leg.
These are named the deep femoral vein and superficial femoral vein.
These problems in the veins are seen less often, the vessel cannot be closed during illness and medical treatment is applied to keep these veins open.
In the leg, there is a superficial vein system which we refer to as the lateral pathway that carries venous blood to the lungs and integrates with the deep vein system in the groin.
The veins, which can be used in heart operations, are the superficial veins called big saphena.
However, the vessels should be healthy for these vessels to be used in a heart operation.
Because the heart is a vital organ.
The operation of removing varicose veins or burning with a laser by leaving them in place via an operation reduces the workload of deep veins and ensures that the leg is healthier.
There are other vessels that can be used in heart operations.
A meaningful message from Özbek before the Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President, Dursun Özbek, published an announcement before the Super Cup Final to be played between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.

Corresponding with the 2nd anniversary of the death of our esteemed rival's dear President, Sülayman Seba and just before the new football season that carries the name of our club's legendary captain, Turgay Şeren, I hope this match will be the match that starts an environment of love and peace in Turkish sports.
I wish that the winner will be our country and Turkish sports whatever the score is at the end of the match to be played in front of tribunes which will be equally shared by the supporters of Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.

Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
You get to win it with your mates.
They finished in 3:51.943.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room with a bunch of people I love, looking at this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
It is a debt of patriotism.
Those who want can add documents to the report application offered by the Security General Directorate.
They were inspired by Bordum and made a 'model village' in Sivas
Gölova District Governorship prepared a model village project to improve the image and quality of life of the villages under the district.

Expected to rank among the biggest funds in the world, Turkey's Wealth fund was removed from the bag bill in a quiet and retiring way upon the objections.
It was decided that the fund would be discussed again because of the lack of an audit mechanism, but it was discussed in the committee without any amendment.
Stating that there should be a consensus for passing the Wealth Fund law, Çakırözer said, "Our biggest concern for this bill is irregularity."
A restriction was not placed on how many resources will be transferred.
No one will be able to call to account how the fund is used.
Therefore, there is no need to establish an unchecked fund outside of the budget.
Why don't you include it in the budget?
Stating that they are not against the transfer of the money collected in the Wealth Fund to investments, but they are against the fact that it is done with a nontransparent mechanism that does not give an account, Çakırözer continued as follows: "It can be discussed whether there is a need for such a fund."
It should certainly be structured in a way that an auditing and responsibility mechanism is brought.
He said, "The desired Wealth Fund may be beneficial only if these concerns are eliminated."
It was reported that work has been done to ensure a consensus between AKP and the opposition on the coming bill of law.
"The investments we made are a sign of the trust we place in Turkey"

Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.
The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.
For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," according to one of the companies that makes that software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.
But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.
She died at the scene.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid impact?
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
