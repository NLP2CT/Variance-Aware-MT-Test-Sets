28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.
Jennifer Aniston need not always be perfect or successful.
That is what the Hollywood star has made abundantly clear in an interview.
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she has been dubbed "Miss Perfect" in the current issue of "Cosmopolitan".
In her new film, "Mother's Day - love isn't child's play", Aniston stars as a single mother with two sons.
Golfer Langer is awarded the Sport Pyramid
His experience on horseback is negligible.
It was a first for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
And with that, his riding career came to an end again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - with 101 tournament wins under his belt - was once again near horses.
The friendly sportsman is not lacking for awards.
The Federal Cross of Merit, the Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has bestowed an honour upon him.
Langer is the 18th person to be awarded the Sport Pyramid.
"This award means a lot to me," said Langer, "because it's not just given for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been encouraging up-and-coming talent for years.
Those given the award include track athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, gymnast Eberhard Gienger, fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Putsch and Arnd Schmitt, rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bob-sleigh rider Meinhard Nehmer, judo player Frank Wieneke, show-jumper Alwin Schockem√∂hle, and, posthumously, handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
After the official part, the illustrious gathering wandered to the show-jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was underway.
Both Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA back up.
"It will either be China, Germany or America - and I want it to be us."
Neither want to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement.
At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better.
They should then also be better paid, Clinton demands.
She wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour.
But the big discussion of the months to come will likely revolve around both parties' tax policies.
Trump is on one side, wanting to relieve the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth.
For women fleeing a country on their own, sexual violence is almost part of daily life.
One house offers refuge.
He looks around the room inquisitively, his eyes wide.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realises she's being watched.
It recently had its official opening.
When women flee, other reasons are in the foreground: "Many women sneak away secretly, because they see no other way out".
That propels them forward.
And it continues even while they're on the run.
"It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a sexual act in exchange for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr.
Even in Germany, lone women are often seen as inferior in refugee accommodation, and, in the worst cases, they are abused.
As a result, around 90 percent of the women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatised, she estimates.
"Some of the children were certainly not conceived with the woman's consent".
Many women are so used to it that they do not say anything, she says.
Because they often don't know how to get help, there needs to be more accommodation just for them, says Bahr.
When asked if they knew of projects like the one in Munich operating within the areas they covered, some answered with "no".
Even in Swabia, women who come as lone refugees are not given separate accommodation, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the region.
The exception is Lower Bavaria: there, there are two central accommodation centres exclusively for women.
Washing facilities, above all, should be separate, and easily accessible for women, according to the study.
"Since word has got around that we exist, we have developed a long waiting list," says Bahr.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.
In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.
In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.
There was the handshake, yes.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also turned since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family are here as well
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
Do the smiles convince?
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
No-one knows yet.
But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson sacked after hitting producer
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement.
I regret that it occurred," he said in a statement.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
Mystery as fish land in Banff garden
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The ¬£1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The ¬£1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.
After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power.
They were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.
Someone was watching over these guys today.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment so he could collect his personal belongings.
Instead, the drunk attacker sliced up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
The police managed to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old man was destroying his ex-girlfriend's clothing, he called his mother.
The 45-year-old and her partner wanted to calm down her brother.
However, she couldn't get him to leave the apartment.
As the two women entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to one side, and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who is going to build Braunschweig's low-cost housing?
The SPD and the Greens think that investors should step up to the plate much more in the future.
How to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 low-cost homes over the next few years?
Firstly, there is the question of who is actually going to build the low-cost homes?
SPD group chairman, Christoph Bratmann, says: "We agree with the Greens: if you want to build on municipal land, you will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future."
However, the main issue for the council, according to Bratmann: "How do we handle investors who want to build on private ground?"
We want investors building on those spaces to keep at least 10 percent, but if possible, 20 percent, of homes as social housing."
The problem, according to Bratmann: "At the moment, there is no agreement between groups."
The Left wants more stringent requirements to be imposed on investors.
Despite that, according to Bratman, the situation in terms of the housing market is also hotting up.
More staff will be needed.
But the program is not quite complete: because the approximately 1260 new homes are to be built anyway.
This will come to 500 homes even by 2020.
In addition, thought must be given to putting homes back into a price maintenance scenario.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
The Greens think there's still room for manoeuvre in the discussions.
Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pok√©mon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).
So how does it work?
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
Jaw-dropping on floor.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about while pregnant.
When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.
Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.
"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He's walking with help, and riding a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers, and singing.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
It gets better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding prompts rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.
Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.
Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.
Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.
He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
I just can't believe it.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
This is such an exciting time.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
The ¬£2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.
Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
Sounds tricky?
Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
But the experiment, which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results.
Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things.
The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
Tourists in Portugal are left terrified as a low-flying military jet flies skims beach
Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives
This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.
Dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'
Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira.
Supercup: Barca is worried about facing Sevilla
The Chilean international and Ter Steigen have been competing for number one status for two years now.
On the other hand, Sevilla have to swallow their 2-3 extra-time defeat against Real Madrid in the Supercup, and are aiming for a second victory in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Rio de Janeiro - Ma Long, from China, is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old beat his fellow countryman and "defending champion" Zhang Jike in Rio de Janeiro 4-0 in a one-sided final (12,5,4,4).
The last non-Chinese athlete on the top step of the Olympic podium was former SVS Lower Austria legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
"In the final, I'm playing for myself," Zhang summarised.
After the game, the gold and silver medallists posed with the Chinese flag.
Donald Trump admits there are "huge problems" with his election campaign
Republican strongholds are wavering
Other bodies do put Trump ahead, but not by the margin usual for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
If he doesn't make it because of political correctness, that's ok, Trump added.
Olympics: Brazen cheating in doping tests
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary committee to handle the case.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would set up a disciplinary committee immediately to investigate the case.
Ferguson Rotich came fourth in the 800-metre race at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi Airport.
Ahead of the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to introduce an anti-doping law and a functioning system of checks.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
The country's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 world championships in Beijing.
As a result, Russia's track and field athletes were banned from the summer games.
Salzburg's "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
Artistic Director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music, and has made a childhood dream come true by taking on the role of Maria.
In the orchestra pit, the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Orchestra will be conducted by Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
She remembers her love affair with Tony with wistfulness, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
"She's very like me, like my Italian personality as a girl from Rome," laughs Bartoli.
For him, conducting is a need.
It is such a great chance to be able to share this musical experience with him.
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, "West Side Story" is bang up-to-date: "This work is all about prejudice and fanaticism."
Fifty-nine years on, the work is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIL killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really," Akunjee said.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.

Turkey: Kurdish community faces mass exodus
The crackdown instigated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup has led the Germany Kurdish Association to expect a mass exodus to Germany.
Many will want to seek a new start in Europe if they continue to suffer oppression in Turkey.
"They are the last big minority in Turkey: the Christian Armenians and the Greeks have already been exterminated or driven out over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the Association requested that the Federal Government acted "as harshly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and members of the opposition.
These figures do not include people who have fled war, poverty or a lack of prospects.
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: Locals hear nothing about the summer elections - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood this.
The locals who need to be won over by the candidates are on holiday.
There are also practical problems to consider: during the holidays, volunteers who put up signs, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and count the votes at the end, are hard to find.
The heated phase, if that can be said at all, has already begun.
Her refugee policies, her "we can manage it" have accelerated the rise of the far-right, he believes - which will probably cost him his job.
The CDU and its top-level candidate, Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what happens when you fight an election in the right place at the wrong time.
"The majority probably came from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained to the NDR recently.
But it won't do any harm to anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkal for once.
Apart from that, the north-east CDU is generally dispensing with the normal election events with parasols and balloons in market squares and outside shopping centres.
According to Kokert, that will only play a "minor role".
The advice that CDU candidate Kokert gave to his competitors is revealing: "You have got to go where it hurts, or where the people are: village fetes, Golden Wedding anniversaries, you have to make use of every birthday party."
Sellering has already called his SPD to fight a particularly committed election campaign because there is so much at stake.
"Online election campaign" is what the regional chairperson Claudia M√ºller has dubbed it.
Her view? "Having an election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern isn't all that bad".
That is a super team.
The commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from M√∂ssingen because speed limits were not always adhered to either.
"There were considerable infringements," said King, who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on.
The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 zone.
Even at the Maier car dealership, Thomas Sulz talked of "a slight loss, at the most", but also admitted that "there had been a lack of passing trade".
It's not just him: all restaurants have been "hit hard".
We have to be happy about every euro of profit we make.
The road redevelopment "set back" his businesses "by two years".
If you can't drive past, other places are also nice.
Six months of construction works, that's brutal.
Law are constantly being passed in the name of anti-terrorism.
After the most recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizi√®re is now putting forward a host of security measures.
But what does residential status have to do with terrorism?
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of the Interior said when revealing his new security package.
Other, more wide-reaching issues will first be discussed within the parties.
I will also be involved in that.
After the most recent attacks in W√ºrzburg and Ansbach, de Maizi√®re let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany.
Neither is the fact that Germany will have to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and gun laws.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a surprise.
"They will be difficult issues for the SPD," admitted the CDU politician.
Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should allow their smartphones to be checked, and present their social media accounts for security checks.
He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit crimes, or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of it is politically and legally tricky.
Some of it also seems half-baked, and leaves questions to be answered.
In addition, many people are worried about security because of the large numbers of refugees.
And things that deeply worry people cannot be ignored - even during election season.
Domestic security has come to the fore to a huge extent.
There is a large amount of uncertainty.
And yes, elections are looming.
Over the past few days things have been quite heated between the two parties.
De Maizi√®re is also trying to strike a conciliatory note here.
And he thinks that a burka ban would come up against constitutional issues.
Volkswagen gets off lightly.
Despite the diesel scandal, global delivery figures are increasing.
The recall has led to fuss about one term.
However, in July, the VW core brand suffered, particularly in Western Europe, thereby affecting overall sales, as the Dax-listed company announced.
Globally, the VW brand sold 449,100 cars in July - 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month in the previous year.
In its home market of Germany, deliveries plummeted by almost a sixth.
Head of brand sales, J√ºrge Stackmann, blamed July's poor figures on the loss of two sales days in Europe.
In addition to the situation regarding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU had also had an impact, a spokeswoman said.
Head of sales at the company, Fred Kappler, was once again able to bring out an increase in sales from January to July.
Legal intricacies are the reason for this.
"Deviations will not be accepted," explained Alexander Dobrindt (CDU), the Federal Minister for Transport, according to the Ministry.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as has been mentioned in corporate circles.
The Raffeisen Bank in Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from wealthy savers in the future - and it will be the second bank in Germany to do so.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The money has been sitting in my account at the Central Bank, and costing 0.4 percent," the bank CEO said.
He is passing on the costs under the "polluter pays" principle.
The Federation of Cooperatives of Bavaria explained that "the extreme monetary policy pursued by the ECG leads to all banks incurring significant costs".
A banker said that, in Tegernsee, there was "clientele who were rather better off in terms of assets."
"That can be a problem for a small bank," if the bank is looking after their money for free.
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."
So, let's take a look.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I suppose I am," he says.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.
He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
That's not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.
We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."
That's younger people, not older ones, late teens who are just getting into it.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
She is window-shopping, rather than on a spending spree.
She doesn't earn a lot, she says, so collecting records isn't really an option.
It costs a lot.
I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.
It is pure "art vinyl."
But, given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is little to complain about.
Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.

Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin keeps his fighting spirit
"It's honestly hard for me to comment on my time from yesterday," said Martin.
Martin had wanted to compete for the title at the time trial World Championship in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to take a real look at everything we've changed recently."
Olympics: Tennis pro Siegemund misses out on the semi-final

Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.
Here, they lost just one.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It alters your outlook a bit.

This feels so much better," she said.
The Managing Director of the "Veitensteingruppe" Water Supply Association, Rupert G√∂ller, is retiring.
A small Franconian drinking water supply association as a role-model for the large water producers.
A little later, the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia praised the Association.
The Veitensteingruppe's work was described as "setting an example for the entirety of Bavaria".
Water supply contracts are in place for additional municipalities and communes.
"His tasks were very varied, ranging from constructing water pipes and performing maintenance work through to office and organisational tasks, budget planning, calculating fees and contributions, through to getting involved in emergencies at weekends," the chairman said.
In her laudatory speech, she praised G√∂ller's loyal, reliable, and upstanding service over 31 years.
He received considerable appreciation and praise for this.
For his part, Rupert G√∂ller praised water officer Alfons Griebel, who had worked alongside him for 28 years.
The management of the Drinking Water Supply Association was passed to Daniel St√ºrmer from Lauter, who will be Rupert G√∂ller's successor.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is open about her son Tiago's autism - and addresses other parents affected by the disease: "You must be brave enough to talk about it."
"Medicine has come a long way," the 44-year-old said to Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
"To give an example: If I ask him what happened two years ago when I sang at Milan's La Scala, he can't remember anything," Netrebko said.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
A 35-year-old man shot and fatally wounded his partner on Friday around 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargeteheide (in the district of Stormarn).
"The man himself called up and admitted to having shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The man should not be approached.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police are talking of a "crime passionelle".
"We are not saying any more at this time," a police spokeswoman in L√ºbeck said.
"I am truly delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negotiations."
According to the German association for the sector, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year.
"It is the first step within our "steel is the future" campaign."
"This needs to be followed by other steps."
The situation only worsened over the past year when the world' biggest producer, China, dumped steel into the global market en masse as a result of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel firms of price dumping.
The German sector leader, Thyssenkrupp, was cautious on Thursday.
Prices had plateaued recently, he said.
The sector is reacting to the tricky situation by reducing prices further.
Thyssenkrupp also did not want to rule out closing individual plants.
Despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remained cautious in July.
At 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less raw steel than in the corresponding month in the previous year, as the steel association reported on Friday.
Since the start of the year, production has been two percent less than the value for the equivalent period in the previous year.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
And additionally, she's doing something good for her health and her mind.
By regularly spending time with others, the elderly can build and maintain social contacts.
Singing can be demanding in the positive sense, Hackler thinks.
If you push your lungs to their limits regularly, you will not run out of breath as quickly in day-to-day life.
And if you are interested in keeping the sound of your voice as you age, too, singing is the perfect hobby.
Singing often has a really special effect on older people, says Ursula LEnz from the German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations.
Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in older people that are often connected to positive emotions from their youth.
Concentrating on one's own voice and a set rhythm, while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challenge.
In particular, older people who live alone can practice how to focus on people other than themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in a choir, Hackler thinks.
Even one's self-esteem is boosted by singing in a choir.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't delay - even if you think you've not got much talent, Lenz suggests.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can approach the parish or churchwarden directly.
If you're interested in singing, you should absolutely join a choir, Hackler thinks.
Female cats react more sensitively than male cats to the mewls of their kittens
To their surprise, the miaowing didn't leave the male cats unaffected - but, compared to their female counterparts, they always acted the same way.
She is the first author of the study published in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" specialist journal this Friday.
They turned towards the speaker quicker if it was playing the sound of a highly agitated kitten.
This ability may be innate, or may develop as the animal reaches sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the male cats reacted at all," the biologist said.
Even in this field a few studies showed that woman reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they had their own children or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski and "Gala" are shooting for the Supercup
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation.
An important football match is taking place in Turkey for the first time following the attempted coup.
Even when announcing the state of emergency after the attempted coup in July, the government emphasised that this would not affect citizens' daily life.
This does not apply to those people suspected of being followers of the imam Fethulla G√ºlen, who is believed to be responsible for the attempted coup.
On Wednesday, Erdogan announced that the night-time "democracy vigils" in public places across the country have come to an end.
Fans of the workers' club Besiktas, in particular, are not traditionally counted among the President's friends.
For cup winners Gala, it will once again depend on Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne native has proved his sporting value over the last season: with 17 goals and nine assists across all competitions, the 31-year-old closed his first season as his club's top scorer.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the goal that led to a 1-0 victory.
The "Fanatik" newspaper praised him, saying "he was the best player on the pitch."
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record-holders came to a happy end.
The season was not good.
"We did it - and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
This is also why fans are hoping that the 31-year-old returns.
"But if Mario wants to come here, all he has to do is say," "Kicker" specialist magazine quoted club chairman Fikret Orman as saying.
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is banned from taking her place on the start line.

Bomb terror in Thailand - One Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Thomas Schn√∂ll, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said early on Friday morning.
A bomb explosion was also reported in Phuket early in the morning.
"The bomb attacks bear the same signature," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee to journalists early on Friday morning.
It is still apparently unclear who is behind the attacks.
Small-scale bombings are a frequent occurrence in Thailand, but they are rarely directed at tourists.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
A little under a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bankok - the majority of whom were foreign tourists.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has the right-wing "Identit√§re Bewegung" movement in its sights.
"In terms of the "Identit√§re Bewegung" movement, we can see clear indicators of efforts against the free, democratic order," said Hans-Georg Maa√üen, head of constitutional protection, to the German press agency in Berlin.
The "Identit√§re Bewegung" is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
"Groups such as the "Identit√§re Bewegung" are trying to approach their target group on their level," said the head of constitutional protection.
It's not calm advertisement for the actual matter at hand.
Young people are particularly vulnerable to this.
In terms of constitutional protection, potential contact of this kind only becomes relevant from a certain point, he says.
It depends on whether the party in question - in this case, the AfD - changes its focus and becomes extremist as a result of particular people who are extremists.
With regard to the clear increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maa√üen said that he would not yet speak of a new right-wing terrorism.
There was the "Old School Society" group or the "Freitaler Group".
"This means that many people have committed crimes who previously paid the far-right no heed, who might have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or the Left, who were then radicalised by far-right sensationalism".
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet sensation
This is shown by Robel Kiros Habte's brave performance at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Centre, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that, sometimes, it was impossible to see him in the televised images.
Habte finally become a viral internet sensation on social networks.
Why was the 24-year-old taking part in the Olympic games?
The Ethiopian was given special permission to take part by the international swimming federation.
This is given out to popularise swimming in underrepresented countries.
Because most athletes from Ethiopia run, Habte wanted to do something different.
Some media outlets dubbed him "Robel the whale".
With reference to his "flabby stomach", the British tabloid "The Sun" mocked his "Dad Bod".
Comparisons were also made with "Eric the Eel".
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race also drew media attention.

"We will take a very, very strong step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
GfK managing director steps down after disappointing figures
Consumer research firm GfK is replacing its managing director Matthias Hartmann.
GfK's managing director wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
Officially, he will take on the role of "board spokesman" until Hartmann's successor has been found.
A company spokesman did not give further details on Friday.
It is currently not clear who will head up the market research firm in the future.
"If that were the case at BMW, the quants would be too," he said.
Incident - Bus slips into a ditch in Krummh√∂rn: eight people injured
On Thursday, an accident involving a coach carrying 43 elderly people in Krummh√∂rn (district of Aurich) led to eight people being injured.
"As a result of the way the bus was positioned, people were not able to leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade freed the passengers.
Uninjured passengers were transported back to Krummh√∂rn's Pewsum district by regular bus.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
In addition, the amount of sewage arriving at all three plants is gradually decreasing.
The conveyor system in the pumping station at Welschenkahl is almost 20 years old, and needs to be completely overhauled; the first clarification pond in the pond treatment plant at Lopp has been operational for almost 20 years and now needs to be dredged, its sewage sludge removed, and an additional ventilation system incorporated to ensure that it will be in line with water law regulations in the future.
Steinh√§user pointed out that, even with a low amount of sewage coming to the three plants, the expenses for running and maintaining them "were significantly impacted".
As a result, Schmidt expanded, the market town had been saved from large maintenance costs for the sewage treatment plants over the past 20 years.

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly enter the public record.
So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.
Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.
It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
"I have no clue," she said.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.
We will always have the breaststroke, and long may it reign.
Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampol√≠n, meaning "diving board."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopefuls must go farther, faster, up and over, in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, other times back and forth up and down the court.
From this, trampoline offers a respite.
Forward motion is not the goal.
He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
It is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.
"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have convulsed the country, spreading into more and more areas.
"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.
Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.
But that may be changing.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle along that jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.
"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.
"That," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very tight rope to walk."
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"
Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront.
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
He introduced new ingredients.
There are brown-rice bowls.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.
In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we still might take them up on it," Mr. Rodriguez said.
The new location has other perks.
A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.
When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I've needed to smell that," he said.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
There was the cream-puff incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
Now the 30-year-old has been killed in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
2,900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people from bombed-out houses and perform first-aid in the war zone.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil protection volunteer showing him during an 11-hour operation to rescue an infant from the ruins of a house went viral in 2014.
"We are now clearing away the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," quoted Bild as his last words before he died.
Greenland sharks only give birth to young at the age of 150.
They were simply lacking the proof.
However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In one animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear.
It may be the case that they hunt down sleeping animals, or patrol on the ocean floor and look out for corpses that have sunk downwards from higher levels of water.
They use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age.
The two smallest sharks had remarkably high levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores.
In fact, the carbon-14 monitor gave a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark an age of 335, while the record-holding shark, at 502 centimetres, was apparently 392 years old.
Now researchers have been able to map this length onto an age.
It is not by chance that such Methuselahs predominantly live in icy waters.
By contrast, a very large animal can invest its resources in having a longer life.
Construction sites coming as a twinpack
Consequently, the business area already marked out in Unterzeitlarn will be expanded to include a further two plots near state road 2112.
Frankfurt will benefit from Brexit
The city on the river Main will soon have the best chance against the competition of Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to draw jobs and companies away from London.
After the Brexit referendum it is unclear whether financial institutions will still be allowed to run European financial business from London.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group expects to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can communicate directly with the authorities," says IW's Professor Voigtl√§nder.
Thanks to its large airport, Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to.
In addition, the city's easily available business properties are a win.
"In Paris it's not all that easy to find vacant high-quality offices," said Voigtl√§nder.
Rents for top-class business properties are 50% higher on the banks of the Seine than on the banks of the Main.
In a table compiled by management consultants Mercer, the city was ranked 7th, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37 th.
Despite the Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's financial capital, according to the economic researchers.
Gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck
Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Chilli-powder condoms, firecrackers boost Tanzania elephant protection
Previously many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.
Municipal council reaches unanimous decision: No new kiosk to be built on the St. Goarer bank of the Rhine
The municipal has now unanimously rejected the application to build a new retail kiosk on the bank of the river Rhine close to the Rhine balcony currently under construction.
Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.
"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.
It adds that the code was now added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia & Iran surges 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
Witnesses wanted: drinks cash-and-carry in Waldbr√∂l raided
A robbery took place on Thursday evening in the drinks cash-and-carry of Rewe XXL on Walbr√∂l's Gerberstra√üe.
Three people dressed in dark clothing and with their faces covered brandished a gun and demanded that staff at the cash-and-carry hand over cash. They made a run for it on foot, and then probably got into a silver VW Golf.
One trip saw the group head to Bretten to visit the petting zoo.
Another saw them visit Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour around the world-famous cloisters.
On warm dates, the group cooled off at the Tiefensee lake in Maulbronn: perfect for jumping into, swimming around in, and paddling.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims at the gates of mercy
On the previous evening, Father Storost set the pilgrims off with a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' cross and the pilgrims.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristry and the high altar.
At the end, all the participants agreed that the trip was characterised by spirituality and a strong sense of camaraderie.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."
That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
The team event is always the best.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
They finished in 3:51.943.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.
Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue.
"In a room with a bunch of people I love, looking at this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in pretty good company.
They are legitimately talented women, excelling in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
With her reality television history, Jenner's position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She, and all of her sisters, are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll ahead of regional elections: SPD and CDU lose out
These are the findings of a representative poll carried out by INSA, a polling institute, on behalf of "Bild" newspaper.
The AfD would be represented in the House for the first time, with 14 percent.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and the Internet in slow motion: The Nokia Communicator was brought to market 20 years ago.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram, and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was released for sale exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
However, 20 years ago, the Communicator sparked a sensation.
This revealed a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
In August 1996, nobody had any idea that the Communicator heralded the start of the smartphone era.
The mobile phone branch of the Finnish company experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up.
In 2015, there were around two billion smartphone users around the world.
Nowadays, every German looks at their phone an average of 88 times a day.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and right across the country, we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few," he said in a statement.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.
A controversial baseball star steps down
Alex Rodriguez' tears ran quicker than the US baseball star had run from base to base, in better days.
"I love this game and this team."
"I'm saying goodbye to both of them," the 14-time All Star Major League Baseball (MLB) player explained.
He signed a ten-year contract, which has brought him 27 million US dollars every year since 2007.
Rodriguez paid this back in terms of playing performance long ago.
However, the 41-year-old cannot be welcomed into the baseball Hall of Fame.
Because no matter how successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the pitch, his behaviour off the pitch was just as controversial.
In August 2013 he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 for his involvement in the "biogenesis scandal".
Rodriguez was the main suspect accused of having received performance enhancing drugs via an anti-ageing clinic in Florida over a period of years.
After a legal battle, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league might even have done me a favour in 2014 - I'd played for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said, summing things up.
"My job isn't about a retirement tour."
"We want A-Rod," the fans sang as they were defeated 4:9 by Rodriguez' team.
Busted: After a sample tested positive for doping, weightlifter Adrian Zielinksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio.
One now-banned athlete had almost won a medal.
The first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition.
Chen was supposed to have taken part in the 50m Freestyle heats on Friday.
Chen applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for a hearing and to have her B sample opened.
The national association is taking the instance "very seriously, and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a press release: "We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision".
Also overnight in Rio, the news about Danekowa's positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all of which were negative, and my fourth test was positive," which was "an unbelievable shock," she said to Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She said she was innocent and that "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance involved was the blood doping chemical EPO.
Danekowa was suspended as a precaution, and according to BNT, a B sample also tested postive.
"I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been banned".
Both deny taking it, but neither was allowed to compete in the weight category of up to 94 kg.
In swimming, China's earlier offence had caused heated disputes between the athletes themselves.
"Sun Yang's pee is purple."
"When I look at the podium for the 200m Freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.
"I have no time and no respect for drug cheats," he said.
Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit out for a three-month ban.
According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany by Malwarebytes, the malware defence specialists, 40 percent of the companies surveyed had fallen victim to one, two, or several attacks involving extortion software in the past twelve months.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid up the ransom demanded by the perpetrators so that they were able to use their systems and data that had been affected by the attack.
In 2008, most malware programmes were still focused on sending out adverts.
Then perpetrators discovered extortion software.
Private users were initially the target, but the shift to corporate attacks took place terrifyingly quickly over the past few months.
The ransomware encrypts these files, and deletes the originals for good.
Finally, the software presents the extortioner's demands.
The victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of "Bitcoins", a cryptocurrency - to get the decryption code needed for the files.
22 percent of German companies affected reported that they had suffered a fall in turnover due to ransomware, 13 percent had to cease trading entirely, and in one instance, people's lives were put at risk.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up get their files back.
Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a good reputation.
A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do try to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money.
Faced with the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional, splitting up their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual can write a ransomware program within about a week."
However, it is more likely that three or four people will be involved.
The extortioners then look out additional hackers to distribute the freshly prepared software between victims.
We live in a service economy.
"Normally, criminals then task spammers with distribution," explains Wisniewski.
In the future, perpetrators will be able to focus themselves on brand-new targets within the internet of things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could take control of a thermostat connected to the internet.
HONDA HR-V is practical and perfect for everyday use
It seems a bit too much, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, does indeed prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use.
The boot is easy to load, but the load height of 650 mm is a bit higher than it is in the Peugeot 2008, which is a comparable model.
The 1.6 l diesel engine we tested, with 88 kW/120 horsepower accelerates the HR-V powerfully, thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm across a wide range of speeds.
However, it could certainly do its work a bit more quietly.
Everyday consumption of 4.7 l/100 km was pleasing.
The steering could be a bit more direct, however.
In the top-flight "Executive" version, which we tested, the fittings leave nothing to be desired.
The safety systems include city emergency braking assistant (functions up to a speed of 32), collision warning system, and the lane departure warning system.
The collision warning system is irritating occasionally: when parking, it sees lots of obstacles as "approaching objects".
However, full connectivity is only available for the top-of-the-range model: 7 inch touchscreen, satnav, app integration, and more.
If you don't want to invest quite that much, the petrol model is available from 20,000 euros, and diesel from 23,000 euros.
The motors comply with euro 6 emissions standards.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger boarding bridge
An airline will not be liable for a passenger's fall on a passenger boarding bridge.
This is because liability only applies for risks typical for aviation travel, the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The claimant had broken a kneecap in the fall.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
When do organisers pay if illness strikes?
They spent almost all their holiday in their room.
It was true that the waste treatment plant was suffering from a fault.
But the organiser only found out about this just before the claimants departed.
In addition, no contamination was found in water samples.
He said that the state must react to the threat of terrorism with prudence and resolve.
One thing is for sure: Our country will not react to the perpetrators' violence with hatred and division.
He also announced that security services would receive more staff, to the tune of "a mid-four figure sum over several years".
SPD Head Gabriel said that "the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further".
He said it was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism.
De Maizi√®re had previously turned down calls from the coalition for a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
You can't ban everything you're opposed to, and I'm opposed to the wearing of the burka.
Head of the Greens, Simone Peter, accused the Minister of wanting to use new anti-terror packages to create an air of energy and ability to act.
Head of the Left, Bernd Riexinger, said that "smooth talking and tightening up residency laws are not going to make the people in this country any more safe".
Better flow of traffic on the motorway slip road
Traffic jams are a regular occurrence on the bypass - here's a photo from November.
But that is about to change: the right-hand turning lane is to be extended.
Next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the State Roadworks Office will extendthe right-hand turning lane in the area between Hammer Stra√üe and the exit from Weseler Stra√üe by 700 metres.
The major advantage is that traffic will split earlier, improving overall circulation on the busy section of main road 51.
On weekdays, the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes even goes over it.
The "Nima's" association enables young people from a migrant or refugee background to visit cultural institutions in M√ºnster.
Within the framework of the "Intercultural Journey" set up by Nima's, 19 pupils aged between 11 and 15 saw the play in the small house.
Rain replaces shooting stars: There is hope that the weather will improve
The weather is supposed to be good, so we'll definitely see lots of shooting stars in the sky.
The shooting stars are the Perseids: some of the quickest shooting stars, travelling at 216000 kilometres an hour.
This is anything but relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are various forms of sleep disorders, and they can have many causes, emphasises Hans-G√ºnter Wee√ü, President of the German Association for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is behind sleep disorders?
"Waking up very early is common with depression, in particular," says Wee√ü.
If you have a slipped disk, for example, you might find it hard to lie down, wake up every couple of hours, and start to grumble about everyday problems and worries, suggests Wee√ü as an example.
There are hardly any registered sleep doctors in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Charit√© University Medicine Centre in Berlin.
Who should go to a sleep lab, and what happens there?
You don't have to prepare for the examination at all.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just - please don't take an afternoon nap," says Fietze.
After being cabled up, you head to bed at your normal time.
In addition, a camera mounted on the ceiling records the sleeper.
How can those affected get a grip on the problems they are experiencing?
Wee√ü lists them: going to bed and getting up a regular times, not staying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching television to get to sleep, avoiding alcohol, and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight away, and that's not helpful at all.
"I'm not saying that we should stop our tests," he went on to explain.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to register with the National Anti-Doping Agency for Germany (NADA) nine months before he started.
This is exactly how it should be with countries.
"If you don't submit to WADA/FINA checks a particular amount of time before the World Championships/Olympics, then you shouldn't be able to take part," the Hamburg resident stated, who now runs an ice-cream parlour.
Airport: A gang of luggage thieves are arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf airport
Plain clothes officers from Dusseldorf's police force managed to arrest two women and two men, aged between 50 and 61, on Thursday.
Around 9.30 p.m. civil servants in Dusseldorf Airport recognised a gang known to the police from previous thefts.
Someone has spraypainted "horrid!" on the facade of a house.
Articles on this "trendy district", as the property company responsible has dubbed Friedrichshain, have been illustrated with pictures of burning cars over the past few weeks.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared on 22 June by 300 police officers, the police patrolled the area for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three vans, closing parts of the street and preventing visitors from accessing house 94.
On 13 July Berlin's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and, one day later, police and builders left the site, to the cheers of supporters and residents.
Near the house project there is a primary school and a kindergarten.
Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was traditionally a working-class neighbourhood. Even today, it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city.
This can be felt in the rents, which have climbed by almost 60 percent since 2009.
One reason for not all neighbours seeing this as a problem could be that they are not directly affected by crime: according to statistics, almost all crimes such as bodily harm are directed against the police.
The majority of crimes are damage to property, which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a block of flats next-door to controversial number 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
"I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction."
But what should you do when nobody listens to you?
If you move here, you should be aware of that - just like someone who moves into an area full of pubs should know they can't really complain about the noise.
The social education worker will assist the management team run by Achim Grockenberger.
The 31-year-old has been in post for around six weeks.
She has taken the 50% job for a fixed term of three years.
It was high time," Regine Kunde said, that Annika Deuschle offered support to voluntary and full-time workers.
There are major problems, minor problems, organisational problems, problems with people, comprehension problems.
New containers will soon be located in Wasenstra√üe
For a while, one major problem has been finding homes subsequently for refugees that have been given certified status.
Communes themselves are responsible for subsequent accommodation.
Responsibility switches from district administration to communes and job centres.
De facto, the administration cannot find any private homes.
According to Deuschle, being reliant on private homes has not worked.
This is why the commune's homes need to be beefed up, as it is so neatly put.
Consequently new containers will soon be located in Wasenstra√üe.
Perspective is the key word, and Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree on that score.
"More jobs would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
This is not "employment therapy".
Being active doesn't just mean working.
The day needs a fixed structure, Deuschle and Kunde say.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
Professional courses are rare.
There is where the administration and volunteers can get involved.
She says it is key that refugees feel as if they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
But there are also problem cases, Kunde says honestly, "people for whom nothing works". As a result, Deuschle and Kunde's work will always be to motivate others.
All told, this is "a mammoth task".
"No," Regine Kunde said clearly, "which some people might call naive". She could not and did not want to ignore the chance of a residual risk remaining.
"They want to show they have nothing to do with it," Regine Kunde said.
Many of them would like to stay in Urbach.
Does Germany need a cap?
Politicians shy away from answering this question.
"In Urbach we've not got to where we wanted to be quite yet," said Annika Deuschle.
But when people are in need, you've got to help them - and both women agree on that.
Schorndorf: Search for intruders made by helicopter
They were heading towards the centre of town.
House searches had revealed evidence and drugs, the police revealed on Friday.
Then they fled.
Damage amounting to 10,000 euros was caused to the snack bar and the neighbouring building.
Strong demand for medical technology in Asia has boosted Carl Zeiss Meditec's turnover.
Over the first nine months of the business year that started in October, the company's turnover grew by 6.7 percent to 789.6 million euros, as the listed company reported on Friday in Jena.
Its business in Asia grew disproportionately, by 17.1 percent.
Profits before interest and taxes increased from 89.5 million euros to 110.5 million euros, according to the interim report.
