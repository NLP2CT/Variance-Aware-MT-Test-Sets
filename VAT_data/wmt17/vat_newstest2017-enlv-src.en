28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.
The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.
The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.
He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.
The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.
But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."
I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.
It has been a rollercoaster ride.
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
No-one knows yet.
Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.
It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.
But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Dynamic on vault.
Effortless on beam.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
This is such an exciting time.
Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.
The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.
He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.
The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.

The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
Thanks for that.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'
Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'
It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.
Sounds tricky?
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.

The only person at whom Ulmanis did not yell during government meetings was General Janis Balodis.
"Zemgals, with his sense of humor and democratic personality leaves the exactly opposite impression," explains Auzins.
Professor Aivars Stranga from the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, in a conversation with "Delfi", agrees with Auzins' evaluation of Zemgals as a calm and level-headed statesman.
It wasn't really his aspiration, nor did he crave fame.
"He did however learn basic French during his presidency," Stranga adds.
Not a huge admirer of Ulmanis, he however did not argue against him publicly.

Simple ways that help dealing with kids' tantrums.
When we adults feel angry or worried, we usually know what's happening to us and how to handle it.
We can do the following with our anger or rage: express, suppress, hide, keep inside, tell our friends or loved ones about it, we can kick the sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, bang our fist on the table or do other things we don't normally do.

"Taking into account the threats, we have enhanced security measures at the international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Kosice," press officer of the Slovakian Ministry of the Interior told news agency AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Center is currently analyzing the received information," he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the capital of Slovakia on September 16, in which all the bloc's countries except Great Britain are going to participate.
Slovakia holds the EU presidency until January.
German researchers discuss the number of "Berlin Wall deaths".
According to a new study, the number of fatalities at the border of former Eastern Germany, greatly subdued by the Communist regime, could be considerably larger than so far believed, but doubts about the actual number of victims have not been cleared yet.
The data publicized by the Berlin Wall museum Checkpoint Charlie on Wednesday show evidence that from 1945 to 1989 the Communist authorities killed 1841 persons trying to escape the territory under their control across its border with the Western allies-controlled territory and later West Germany.
Another 11 fatalities were added to the list this year, including a six year old boy who drowned when his family tried to get to Western Germany through former Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
"The scale of total damage, caused by the double evil of Communism and Socialism has not been fully documented," director of the museum, Alexandra Hildebrandt, admits.
"The number of 1841 is unconvincing," the East Germany history expert Johann Stadt from the Free University of Berlin stated in an interview to Süddeutsche Zeitung.
Different methodologies could be one reason for the different numbers of victims.
The Checkpoint Charlie museum also counts in all suicides of East German border guards, whether or not related to their service.
The museum also counts the fatalities not related to direct use of force.
"If seniors aged 70 to 80 died from a heart attack after a stressful contact with the border control," it also must be considered a consequence of the "murderous border", Hildebrandt believes.
At the request of the federation the coach of Uvis had agreed to help her.
Pone, who is a member of the LOC executive committee, harshly criticized LOC's activities when they blamed the organization supervising the Olympic sports.
The situation changed every day, and the number of available accreditations also changed.
He praised the work of the federation and noted that the World Championship tournament could take place in Latvia in 2018.
600,000 salmon smolts to be released in the Daugava.
More than 600,000 one year old salmon and sea trout smolts will be released in the Daugava estuary this year.
This is the second year when smolts to be released are marked by cutting off the adipose fin.
Fish stock propagation in Daugava and other watercourses of its basin pursuant to the laws and regulations is carried out by Bior on the basis of expertise of damage caused to fish stock resulting from Latvenergo's industrial activity and an opinion is formulated on what compensation measures are to be taken to ensure fish stock diversity.
The cooperation with the association, promoting natural spawning of fish, is an initiative additionally supported by Latvenergo within the framework of fish stock recovery.
You sleep in a tent, eat like in restaurant, walk in sneakers and listen to fine chamber music and at the same time enjoy the quiet and peaceful nature: this is a combination offered by the alternative chamber music festival "Sansusi", inviting visitors to the Akniste region for the third summer already.
We open the festival's gates on Friday at 5 PM, and the first concert starts at 7 PM.
The splendid roster of performers boasts such names as violin player Eva Bindere, cello player Kristine Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinet player Guntis Kuzma, trumpet player Janis Porietis, piano player Reinis Zarins, quartets Quadra and RIX and even the Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who has created a contemporary circus piece called Confines portraying an artist's inner struggle and performed together with musicians Eriks Kirsfelds, Martins Zilberts and actress Ance Strazda.
Ikauniece-Admidina at3:35 PM Latvian time will participate in 100-meter hurdles, and at4:50 PM she is doing high jump.
The heptathlon events finish on Saturday with long jump, javelin and 800 meters as the last disciplines.
Ikauniece-Admidina, who won bronze in last year's world championship, was mentioned as a candidate for winning an Olympic medal before the games began.
He was overcome by the Japanese judoka Ryunosuke Haga, who eventually won bronze.
Back in the year 2000, Vsevolods Zelonijs brought Olympic bronze to Latvia, but during the consequent four Olympic Games Latvian judo fighters have won only one in seven fights, accomplished by Borodavko in London.
On Wednesday, this race was postponed due to unfavorable weather.
Puspure will compete in theC/D women's single sculls semifinal for the 13th place at the Olympics at 7:10 PM.
At Tuesday's quarter-final, she won the fourth place stepping down from the third position she held, which would have allowed her to poise for a medal - however, she fell behind by a mere 0.65 seconds.
Puspure won the 13th place four years ago at the London Olympics, where she also represented Ireland.
24 sets of medals will be granted in today's Olympic events: archery, track and field, track cycling, equestrian, fencing, diving, judo, rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
The motorcycle's owner had placed an advertisement that he was selling a motorcycle.
A potential buyer arrived at the agreed time, sat on the motorbike supposedly to test-drive it and then rode away.
Greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying the sharks, says record goes to a female thought to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five metres in length
French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."
The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
Here, they lost just one.
This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.
It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.
What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
It alters your outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.
I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.
Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in the moment.
Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.

An open, industrial loft in DTLA gets a cozy makeover
According to his words, now it is "important in principle" for the Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Union of Greens and Farmers) and the Minister for Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers), that Kolegova's candidacy for the position of the head of the SRS, supported by the Minister for Finance, is approved.
Kolegova was promoted for the position of the SRS head by the Minister for Finance, Reizniece-Ozola, after Inara Petersone stepped down from this position and the competition for the position of Director General of the SRS ended without results.
Additional sanctions would only add to such negative moods.
In Spain's case, the situation is more complicated.
Cleanness of beaches around the Gulf of Riga is in critical condition.
The most polluted swimming areas are located in Riga.
Except Liepaja's beach and several places in Kurzeme, cleanness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is in a similar critical condition.
The activists, after walking along the Riga Gulf for the fifth year already, have realized that the amount of garbage discarded by visitors per hundred meters has increased.
This year, even fluorescent light-bulbs were found among the household waste items and picnic remains littering the beach sand.
The swimming areas of Riga are also on the list of the dirtiest beaches.
Therefore Vidauskis calls on the visitors of bathing places to even report polluters to the police.
"We all must address the authorities and must be intolerant towards such violators," he stresses.
"We will take the last samples of water at the end of August," Normunds Kadikis, senior specialist in environmental health issues of the Inspectorate, revealed.
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave his position but will remain as the President's special representative in nature preservation, environmental and transportation matters.
According to information available to Lsm.lv, Ivanov is a Colonel General of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
He started his career in secret services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov was assigned as his deputy.
Vaino comes from a family of Soviet party elite.
For the last five years, we keep in touch with each other on an almost daily basis.
Vaino comes from a family that was part of the Soviet party elite.
The online media outlet Meduza, using a book "Estonian Self-determination and Independence" as it source, has reported that in late 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to authorize violent oppressive actions against participants of political rallies.
Shortly afterwards Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.
However, he left the diplomatic career to work in the Presidential Protocol Administration.
Judo fighter Nikiforenko loses in the first fight of the Olympics.
Therefore the judo contest in Rio is over for Latvia.
Athletes' dreams crushed in Rio sand.
Therefore the Judo Federation's president's promise to win medals in Rio came as if from another galaxy in the Morning Panorama news.
Dreams are far from reality.
The intrigue was just like in a "death" group, because the Olympics is over for those who lose.
A protracted previous game just added to their stress.
The gusty wind created additional complexity for the players.
One could observe a chain pattern: unconvincing return of a serve, the second pass sometimes flies too close to the net and Samoilovs having few options for an efficient attack.
This time luck had also turned away: in the third set alone, two attacks by Evandro almost went outside the court, but the ball did hit the line.
Two aces landed next to the line.
Perhaps some confidence was given to them by a series of seven semifinals.
Or perhaps, they should not have played in Klagenfurt and instead arrive here earlier and adapt to the situation.
What's next?
There remain a few World Cup tournaments and also the Jurmala "Masters".
But it is also not necessary .
US men's basketball team lives on a cruise ship, and some tennis players do not stay at the Olympic Village.
Also some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copacabana.
This time the modest accommodation offered to journalists was overpriced.
Together with Vladimirs we rented an apartment on the border of Copacabana and Ipanema.
The beach was 200 meters away and the beach volleyball arena in 30 minutes' walk.
P.S. It looks like another dream about medals has died on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidina fell behind her previous personal records in 100-meter hurdles and high jump.
"Porgy and Bess" returns to stage after 10 years' break in Liepāja.
The opera "Porgy and Bess" was first performed in Latvia in 1973, as a production of the Latvian National Opera.
"Porgy and Bess" is a story told in vivid operatic language about love, its impermanence, passion as well as everyday tragedies and simple joys of daily life.
The concert version in the new concert hall Great Amber was significant due to the facts that an orchestra was playing in the orchestra pit for the first time and that an opera concert version was staged for the first time.
The square near the renovated building of the Latvian Museum of Art could be named after Janis Rozentals.
The Riga Vice Mayor Andris Ameriks announced during the opening of the Rozentals anniversary exhibition that the museum's address in the future might become 1 Janis Rozentals Square instead of 10a Krisjana Valdemara Street.
"But if you, Mr Ameriks, promise to think about that"... said Lace.
As reported, the building of the National Museum of Art, after a major reconstruction and modernization, re-opened this May.
Even though a year has passed, the renovation has not started and the collectives have continued working in unsuitable conditions.
The first one concerns improvements of the VEF Culture Palace's accessibility and landscaping of the surrounding area.
The second part concerns improvement of the VEF Culture Palace's range of services.
Band members' costumes, instruments, awards and taped live performances as well as other items yet unseen by a wider public yet telling the story of "Livi" will also be on display.
The visual design of the exhibition was created in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Such popular musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krievins, Modris Sterns, Valdis Starks, Laims Racenajs, Talis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brize, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many more can be mentioned among the participants of the band.
Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.

Zbignevs Stankevics: when the time comes, the truth is resurrected.
It is because the power of truth is greater than evil's whim.
What message will be received by the followers of religion this year?
In the recent years, the Pope's nuncio has expressed a desire to lead the main church service at Aglona.
Therefore, the content of the main message is left at his discretion.
I lead the service of vigilia on the day before.
Last year, I addressed Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato si" and rose the topic of "common home" and the subject of Earth in the context of Latvia.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of person's life and inspires them in their further path.
In that way, it speaks to people.
But in Cesis, at the Lampa discussion event you said that "we have to return to an understanding of the complete man".
Does it mean that a person turns away from the message spread by the church?
A dying man robbed on roadside in India.
As reported, a man identified as Mathibul used to ride his rickshaw during day and also worked nights as a security guard.
Mathibul went home at 5:30 AM along the roadside and was knocked down by a car.
Recordings from surveillance cameras show that the driver stepped out of the car to look at the victim but then left.
An hour later, while nobody paid attention to the bleeding man, he was robbed by a thief.
Approximately 90 minutes after the accident, police arrived at the spot and the injured man was brought to a hospital where he died from his injuries.
Due to objections voiced by Unity, on Wednesday the government postponed Kolegova's approval for the position of Director General of SRS for one week.
Andrejs Vaivars , the Press Secretary of the Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis, explained to LETA that a new competition would be organised for the vacant position of General Director of the SRS.
Car accident in Riga center involves a police car.
A car accident involving a police car occurred in Riga center this afternoon.
The police car with turned on sound and light signals was in a hurry for a top level call when it collided with another car at the intersection of Krisjana Barona Street and Dzirnavu Street.
A woman has suffered in the accident.
Riga's population has shrunk this year.
At the beginning of this year, there were 638,784 residents in Riga, which is by 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641,000 residents had officially declared their domicile in the capital city, the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB) told LETA.
Warning pictographs will be used by LNMA.
In the coming days, warning signs in the form of pictographs will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Arts (LNMA), the Riga City Council Property Department representative Baiba Gailite told the LETA news agency.
In the next few days warning pictographs will be placed there.
A spacious, multifunctional ship-like play-structure with various climbing elements, little bridges, games, tubes and slides has been set up on the Kipsala beach.
The playground is intended for children of all ages.
There are also swings and various balancing challenges.

Road connections and lighting in the center of Medumi center have been improved as part of the project.
This product combination can increase the amount of burnt calories after the meal even by up to 35 percent.
Oatmeal porridge with fresh berries is another kind of tasty fat-burning breakfast, worth including in your menu.
Vegetables contain water and dietary fiber therefore they also make you feel full.
For lunch, you may want to choose chicken with salad or prepare a dose of protein mix and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
Food combinations to avoid.
By comparison, the starch found for example in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
Therefore it is essential not to eat a dessert right after a meal.
If you do eat the dessert right after, it becomes "trapped" in the stomach together with other foods, yet it is not properly chemically digested and starts putrefying.
Certainly avoid consuming bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other high-carbohydrate foods together with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other sour fruits.
The enzyme ptyalin, found in saliva, is active only in alkaline environment.
Different digestive fluids are required for digesting these, each fluid having a different acidity, characteristics and time to appear in the stomach.
Watermelon, honeydew, muskmelon and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach together with other foodstuff.
Fat makes a good combination with starch, but that is not the case with fats and proteins: fat impedes the digestion of proteins.
However, proteins can be combined with small amounts of fat.
Best ways of cooking.
"Cooking by heating the ingredients results in considerable loss of nutrients - about 15 to 55 percent of their initial nutritional value," points out the dietician.
The most recommended cooking method for vegetables is steaming.
After 30 minutes of boiling, the lycopene level in tomatoes rises by 25 percent.
Thermal processing also considerably increases the availability of beta-carotene, found in red, yellow and orange plants, for instance tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Thermal processing of eggs and meat change some of the proteins' natural properties thus making them easier to digest.
Iron is necessary for producing hemoglobin, which in its turn transports oxygen to muscle and brain.
To get the ultimate benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed oil.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.
The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Setting Up Showdown With Britain
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.
The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."
Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters inside the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.
At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.

Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.
How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.
The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
We were appalled and shocked by the incident.
That needs no explanation.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
The team event is always the best.
You get to win it with your mates.
It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.
He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.

In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
A new page has thus been opened.
The day starts with a sports contest.
After the sports games everyone gathered near an open-air stage where the festival began.
The festival continued with congratulation of the youngest residents of Kulciems.
And it is not a big deal that a few feet slipped on the wet stage.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.

The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
She died at the scene.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The petition was drawn up on August 10 and currently has been signed by 55 persons.
Promotion of candidate for the position of Director General of SRS, Inga Kolegova, is not transparent and professional.
In three pool play matches the Latvian athletes got one victory but two other pairs had the same ratio.
The mutual small-score ratio was considered further, which was the most adverse for the Latvian pair after the apparent loss suffered in this match.
We started it similarly, but after we switched sides, the result was going up only for one team.
All pool play teams were similar, there were three sets in almost all matches therefore small-scale points were important.
"We had to play more similar rather than repeatedly losing 3-4 points in a row," the athlete told.
"We managed it in the 1st set, but in the 2nd set we lost 1-2 points, while in the 3rd set with +4 their game was on the way up," Smedins recalled.
We tried to show our best game.
Samoilovs told that, unlike in the previous match, today the athletes were not as nervous.
"We went and played and we had a defense, but we could be better in returning the serves," said the athlete.
I think that there will be no questions and we'll go on playing as the same team, because this situation occurred only in one tournament.
Meanwhile for Smedins it was the second Olympics.

McCartney: presence of Yoko Ono jeopardized The Beatles.
Paul McCartney has admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono made the legendary band The Beatles feel jeopardized.
The 74 year old rock star ''maintains'' good relations with the widow of John Lennon, but back when she came to visit the band in the recording studio, McCartney was afraid of her, because she was the only woman in the company of the band members George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the relationships between them, he told to Rolling Stone that "they are really good."
Back then we felt threatened.
She sat on the amplifier while we were recording.
The majority of the band could not stand it.
We weren't sexists but girls usually did not come to the recording studio, they'd let us do our thing.
The author of the hit song Yellow Submarine also admitted that he now regularly communicates with Ringo, the former band member, and occasionally approves the work plans of the recording studio Apple, but in other terms The Beatles have ceased to exist.
When asked, whether he still meets the other remaining member of the legendary rock group, McCartney revealed to Rolling Stone: "not very often".
We meet at social events and parties.
I left Apple during my complicated divorce.
The company now works in such a manner that I have to only listen to the records.
I am a part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.
He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.
