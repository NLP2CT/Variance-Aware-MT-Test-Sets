But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Tip Line at 415-575-4444.
Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, stated that the previous meeting of the UN Security Council on Crimea was useful, Interfax reports.
The Russian men's team made it into the final of the 4x100 m medley relay.
The Russians placed sixth.

The size of Italy's national debt has grown to record levels
The country's central bank stated that this number represents a historic high, RIA Novosti reports.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviatsionny Foundation, which was created by management at Domodedovo airport to help victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to the airport's press secretary, Alexander Vlasov, two other claims are currently under consideration.
In 2011, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in the international arrivals area at Domodedovo.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 37 people were killed and another 172 were injured.
Scientists have discovered an animal that can live for 500 years
An international team of biologists have come to the conclusion that the longest-living vertebrate is the Greenland shark, which can live for approximately 500 years, RT reports.
Previously, it was thought that the longest living of all the vertebrates was the shark's ‘neighbour’: the Greenland whale.
The oldest such specimen known to scientists was slightly older than 210 years.
Putin changed the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed a decree to amend the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, the Kremlin press service reported.
Deputy Secretary of the Council, Rashid Nurgaliyev, was excluded from the list of permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vaino, Presidential Plenipotentiary to the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Menyailo, and Plenipotentiary to the Northwestern Federal District, Nikolai Tsukanov, were included on the Council.
Ivanov is appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for Environmental Protection, Ecology, and Transport.
Anton Vaino, who previously held the post of deputy to Sergei Ivanov, is appointed the new head of the administration.
In the setting of a health resort, a person can check the state of their body and receive recommendations from a doctor about how to live so that their health does not fall apart.
These types of recommendations are useful to everyone.
‘I'm just burnt-out from work’, is an important signal from the body that shouldn't be dismissed.
But about 90% of visitors feel stressed.
Moreover, the people who are most susceptible to it are from large cities and between the ages of 45 and 55.
In general, it is advisable to undergo treatment at a health resort 2 times a year, especially for people of a mature age.
The main draw of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region is, of course, its healing mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Yessentuki, and Narzan.
For example, Narzan has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and repairs the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the metabolism.
New Yessentuki offers anti-inflammatory, choleretic, and diuretic effects.
The water at Slavyanovsky has the same effect.
Nowadays, various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are also available at health resorts.
It offers anti-inflammatory, resolving, and immunomodulatory effects.
There, you can also take baths in wine, pearls, iodine-bromine, selenium, and sage-liquorice, depending on what the doctor prescribes for you.
Extending the fruiting period.
Yuliya Belopukhova, an agronomist and dacha dweller, explains.
We top-dress all tomatoes, regardless of their ‘type’, as well as peppers and eggplant, with an ash-superphosphate extract and treat them with biologicals (Dozrevatel, to speed up the ripening and growth of the fruit; Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Baktofit, to ward off diseases; Immunotsitofit, to strengthen immunity; and Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm, if there are pests).
We do the final watering of the plants.
In the greenhouse, we lower the long climbing cucumbers from the trellis so that the lower bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) is laying on the ground, then we water it with a warm water and Zircon solution, and cover the stem in 5-7 cm of compost.
To protect against night-time cold, drape material over the garden bed.
Signs of the end.
This figure represents the smallest decline since the beginning of 2015.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade also recently spoke about the stabilising situation.
Slow growth ahead.
Experts from the regulatory authority increased the GDP estimate model for the current quarter to 0.4%, while the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
If you take into account the fact that it's a leap year, it is clear that the trend of a 1% increase in the consumption of electricity can be partially attributed to the additional workday.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover has slowed from -32.8% in January 2016, to -20.7% in May.
In annual terms, this figure has declined by 4.8%.
As a rule, its share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
Some were brought to a different country by their parents during childhood, leaving no choice.
AiF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of the 27-year-old girl, it is written that her name is Lisa Ryzih.
Just like her sister, Lisa chose pole vaulting.
Her highest achievements in this sport are bronze at the 2010 European Championships and silver at the continental competition in 2016, which she won, once again, amidst Yelena Isinbayeva's absence.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious proselytisers of an evangelical branch.
For the most part, they left for the United States, because of their religion, when the young girl was just three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena already started to get involved in wrestling in school.
Prior to this, in fact, she managed to win silver at the World Championships in 2010.
After this, there was a bronze in 2013 and a silver in 2014.
Up to that point, the girl was engaged in her favourite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having immigrated to the United States, she quickly joined that country's youth team, and later also pushed her way into the main national team.
Another one of our former ‘rhythmic gymnasts’ is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who competes for Team Germany.
Jana was born in Tolyatti.
Ira is an alumna of a Volgograd sport school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became national champion.
In Rio, she didn't perform as well as she would have liked.
Her best placing was 40th in the individual all-around.
During that time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, Russian champion, and an international class Master of Sports of Russia.
When he stopped making it onto our national team, the time had come to start thinking about changing nationality.
Back home, there is even less known about another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, than about Swiss swimmer, Maria Ugolkova.
It is there that Mikhail started to get involved in artistic gymnastics.
He didn't achieve great success at the international level.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in artistic gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nastya, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was just 9 years old, her family immigrated to Israel.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronised swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo programme.
When the boy was just 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry had already become national champion.
In addition to high jump, Dmitry also does long jump and triple jump.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognised as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon thereafter, he decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family remained as permanent residents.
In 2015, as a part of the national team, he became the bronze medal winner at the European Championships, which were held in his new homeland.
The original goal was Norway, but it wasn't possible to get into this northern country, and they had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.
Soon thereafter, he won the Junior World Championship, and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
But this time, the story is about a native of North Ossetia who immigrated to Spain: it's about Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and, currently, he competes for this country's national team.
Before this, of course, the 30-year-old athlete also managed to produce very good results in Russia.
Tired of not making it onto the team, Taimuraz decided to change sports nationality.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started to box.
‘The head of state appointed Anton Vaino as Chief of Staff of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation by decree, relieving him of his current post’, reads a decree signed by Putin and published on the Kremlin website.
Since May 2012, Vaino has been Deputy Chief of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation.
Anton Eduardovich Vaino was born on 17 February 1972, in Tallinn.
His father, Eduard Vaino, is Chairman of the Cuba-Russia Business Council of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation and Vice President of External Relations and Cooperation with Shareholders at OAO AvtoVAZ.
His grandfather, Karl Vaino, was First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Estonia from 1978 to 1988.
On 22 May 2012, he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation.
He is fluent in English and Japanese.
He is married and has a son.
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, 'Cossacks need to be educated not with campaigns and parades, but in a systematic manner'.
Housing and communal services continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, artificially high prices are one of the most common crimes in the sphere of housing and communal services.
While the expenses of OOO IV-Consulting (supplies cold water) show that 4 million roubles were spent hiring cars at above-market prices.
And there are a host of examples like this throughout the country.
Makarov's fraudulent scheme is sadly typical of Russia.
According to investigators, between 2012 and 2013, he established 6 property management companies and created 3 limited liability companies in Elizovo in Kamchatka Krai.
It's fairly difficult to litigate in the housing and communal services sector.
We don't have time to start working on one law, before we devise a new one that is necessary to get the previous one to work.
There are also too few experts, including judges, in the area of housing and communal services.
Refusals to initiate criminal proceedings and red tape during investigations are even reported in the Prosecutor General's Office.
But what is meant by the falsification of tenants meeting minutes?
It means: a change in the management of the building, and financial and other issues that circumvent the opinion of the owners.
It turns out that tenants are losing out, and so are small and medium businesses.
Primarily, due to the eradication of corruption, in and of itself, throughout the state, assures Anton Zharkov, a member of the Duma Committee on property issues.
And currently, this work is actively underway.
It's not just isolated actions: it's a deliberate policy of fighting corruption.
Of course, not all regions are in such a sad state.
Well, because the city government has shown an iron will and has established order, Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the Duma Committee for security and combating corruption, told AiF.
The public's awareness about the rights of owners and the responsibilities of resource-supplying and property management organisations is very high.
Probably, all of this is what explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So, it turns out that everything depends on the will of regional authorities?
Perhaps the weak-willed should change jobs?
The Turkish gambit.
He announced this while speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdoğan urged the Americans to withdraw support for the Fethullah Terrorist Organisation.
‘Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (Fethullah Terrorist Organisation).
According to Recep Erdoğan, Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States, acted as their mentor.
Erdoğan's supporters have also suggested that the Americans might also have been directly involved in the coup.
The United States has denied all the accusations made against it, refuses to extradite Gülen, and has advised a change in tone.
‘Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the EU if Brussels does not set a date for the cancellation of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens’, Turkey’s Minister for EU Affairs, Ömer Çelik, stated on 9 August.
His words were in response to a corresponding statement from Turkey’s Foreign Minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country would consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if they didn't receive the expected support from it.
Director of the International Institute for Political Expertise, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdoğan is playing his game right now and can't afford a serious confrontation with the West.
There are no guarantees that, after some time, the President of Turkey won't change his priorities once again.
Having found himself between the two poles of the West and Russia, he will try to seek maximum benefit for himself’, Mukhin believes.
A different point of view is espoused by Anna Glazova, Head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East.
According to her, the policy currently being carried out by Erdoğan is a return to the foreign policy concept that was being pursued by Turkey before the start of the Arab revolutions.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
I lost count.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.
Russia could claim a victory of sorts.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
The number has slumped by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.
Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."
It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.
The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.
Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.
Do the smiles convince?
This is a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?
In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.
He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced.
There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement.
Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to come at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017
Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.
Happily, it all went very well.
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.
The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world turns.
I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).
The launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response, which overloaded servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.
As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.
So what?
A breakthrough has occurred.
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.
The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.
Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Dynamic on vault.
The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.
Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.
A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.
Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.
Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.
Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle, the report states.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
He's walking with help, and riding a bike.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.
It gets better.
You know it will get better for you.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.
He also said that flooding downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat, as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas.
Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.
It came up to my waist.
Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.
In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.
"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
Family tells the station he is expected to recover.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.
Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.
So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.
She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.
The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
This is powerful.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.
This is such an exciting time.
The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.
Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report
The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.
Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.
Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.
Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid
Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.
'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.
Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'
Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????
Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out
Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being
Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark
Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf
The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.
That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'
To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.
'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.
'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'
'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'
All the product in question has been removed from sale.
How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.
You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.
A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.
Sounds tricky?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.
A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.
The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
We did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian."
Naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.
Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low
This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.
Dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds.
The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
The HACCP system has been mandatory for food services for more than a year already, but it still hasn't been implemented in the majority of cafes and restaurants in Saint Petersburg.
Inspections are becoming more prevalent and a business faces fines of up to 1 million roubles.
But so far, officials are only issuing fines for specific violations of the rules (see ‘The List of Documents’...).
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost a company 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but it won't seriously affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are getting ready for school or are spending their holidays in other countries.
‘Turkey has a chance to attract lots of tourists if it provides very budget-friendly offers – 50-60 thousand roubles for a trip for two – because there are people who intentionally wait for very cheap tours’, says Valery Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel travel agency.
Otherwise, there's no sense in counting on a buying frenzy; the majority of travel has already been planned.
‘The establishment of charters to Turkey is good news for the next season’, agrees Valeriya Rubtsova.
Milk is issued to workers engaged in harmful labour conditions according to the established rules prescribed in Article 222 of the Labour Code of the Russian Federation.
Moscow's Gazstroibank has lost its license from the Central Bank.
A temporary administration has been appointed at the bank for a period of validity up until the appointment of the bankruptcy manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution have been suspended in accordance with federal laws.
JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
According to accounting statements, as of 1 August 2016, JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK held 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation in terms of assets.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIL killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Notices about unscrupulous online stores will be distributed to Muscovites.
Rospotrebnadzor reported this, writes M24.
It is reported that the agency's experts are preparing a notice, which will help citizens to properly choose an online store and to recognise possibly fraudulent schemes.
Recommendations on how to properly lodge a complaint and so forth will be included in the appendix’, Rospotrebnadzor said.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of the Moscow Department of Rospotrebnadzor, and it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
They include Evgeny Alexandrovich Panov and Andrei Romanovich Zakhtei.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future’, stated Alexei Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.
The agency suspects 16 Russian stores of price collusion.
As reported by Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be seen as 'encouraging or motivating suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents'.
The Ostankino District Court confirmed the violation of specified requirements for the distribution of information products among children and ruled to impose penalty in the form of a fine and confiscation of 49 copies of the printed product, which were seized by the Rospotrebnadzor directorate.
A source from New Book confirmed that the incident concerned Stace Kramer's work.
An evening in memory of Ernst Neizvestny will be held in Moscow.
An evening in memory of the sculptor, Ernst Neizvestny, will be held in Moscow, TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August, at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to Neizvestny, face-to-face, in the United States.
Close friends of Neizvestny have been invited to the evening event, including: the poet, Yevgeny Yevtushenko; the artist, Boris Messerer; President of the Pushkin Museum, Irina Antonova; the director, Mark Rozovsky; as well as Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky; Head of the Department of Culture for Moscow, Alexander Kibovsky; and Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier, it was reported that Ernst Neizestny's relatives plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably before 14 August.
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
So, let's take a look.
Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says.
He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?
As a collector myself, I have that, and I think a lot of people do.
"We're like their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records.
The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.
We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
She doesn't earn a lot, she says, so collecting records isn't really an option.
It's easy to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh.
I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.
But, given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.
They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.
Microdistrict libraries invite the young residents of Svobodnensky District to attend educational programmes.
This week, library branches will hold events devoted to City Day, the Year of Film, and even Day of the Athlete.
The programmes are oriented towards children, so for the most part, they will be play-based.
Today, 10 August, Library Branch No. 2 in Zaliniine Microdistrict invites the public to check out the presentation, ‘My little town’.
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass sees them take gold
The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.
It has been some journey for GB.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.
With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.
A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.
Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.
The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.
It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.
Which is pretty much how it is.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle
Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.
Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.
I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.
If they don't it goes everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.
It was an incentive.
Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."
It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.
It's really important not to get carried away.
The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.
That would have meant too much pressure.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
The government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned goods
The corresponding decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official internet portal for legal information.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, and is now valid until 31 December 2017.
The disposal of food products imported into the country in contravention of the embargo has been underway in Russia since August 2015.
On the hunt for ‘prohibited goods’
Rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
During the day, the air will warm to 25 degrees Celsius.
Rain with thunderstorms is also forecast for Oryol, Kursk, and Voronezh Regions, Dni.ru reports.
The import rate is in excess of commitments assumed by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
Currently, it consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
Poland suggests that it will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
This was announced by Bohuslav Marzec, Vice President of Finance for the Polish company.
Currently, Gazprom occupies the dominant position in gas shipments to Poland.
That being said, a month earlier, Poland made a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic metres of gas through Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Board for the holding.
An auction for the allocation of Nord Stream 2 capacities will be held in 2017, and it is planned that an auction for its installation will take place in the autumn of 2016.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the mere fact that Poland's PGNIG filed a complaint with the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not necessarily mean that negotiations have broken down.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
This was announced by Principal Deputy Chief of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
Observers were monitoring what was happening at three checkpoints on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
The video recording was posted by 360 TV.
The incident occurred at 4:30 a.m. Moscow time.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, and there were no injuries.
The Volga District Transport Investigation Department of the Investigative Committee of Russia has begun the process of determining the reason for the liner's rough landing.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence blamed the opposition group, Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki, for the incident.
Soon thereafter, it came to light that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by one of the victims speaking to BBC.
UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: ‘there is a lot of evidence that this actually did take place’.
The prohibition of the use of chlorine gas for military purposes is spelled out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
‘We have to send bulk cargo in convoys of trucks into an area where the roads are virtually destroyed and those that remain are mined’, reported Mr Egeland. But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table’.
Four people were killed as a result of a series of explosions at resorts in Thailand.
Four people were killed and 19 were injured as a result of the attack.
Ten foreigners, citizens from four states, were among the victims; there were no Russian citizens among them.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organising the explosions.
The attacks happened in popular tourist areas such as Patong Beach in Phuket, and in the cities of Hua Hin, Trang, and Surat Thani.
The first individuals suspected of preparing and organising the attacks have already been detained, reported Police Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.
It's too early to draw conclusions, said Mr Patanacharoen.
According to statements by Police General Sithichai Srisopacharoenrath, the bombs were remotely detonated within a half hour of each other.
It is already known that one of the four killed was a young Thai woman selling street food.
There were no Russian citizens among the victims of the explosions, the press service of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency reported.
It was prepared by the constitution drafting committee appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide if they support a system in which the upper house of the parliament is entirely appointed by the military and has a significant role in electing the Prime Minister of the country.
Recall that, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the country's army, Prayuth Chan-ocha.
According to him, the army was prompted to take this step by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
How Bangkok ended up in a state of emergency
The special security arrangement lasted for 60 days.
The explosions were carried out by unidentified individuals on motorcycles.
Kommersant has learned that the government has been asked to approve a proposal for the terms of an auction for the gold deposit, Sukhoi Log, while preserving two key restrictions.
They could announce the auction in August and hold it in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has submitted to the government a draft of the regulation and auction terms for the world's largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, with 130 million ounces in reserves and resources), said two of Kommersant's sources who are familiar with the situation.
The draft was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them elaborated.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment confirmed to Kommersant that the draft was submitted to the government.
The representative in charge of subsoil use, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, told Kommersant that the official's administrative office has not yet received the draft.
‘The auction could be announced as early as August, immediately after a government order is issued, and given the timeframe for the submission of applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender could take place as early as October’, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment said.
According to Kommersant, two key requirements for potential participants were preserved in the wording of the version of the draft that was submitted for approval to the ministries and the Federal Executive Authority in July (Kommersant has a copy).
According to the two articles of the federal law mentioned in the draft, which Kommersant already wrote about on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (a 25% share and higher) are not tax residents of Russia or who have dual citizenship need not be permitted access to the auction.
The requirement of state participation in the capital of auction participants was proposed by Irkutsk Region, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment told Kommersant in December 2015, which was later confirmed by the region's governor, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, ‘who had an agreement on investment projects with Rostec’.
Kommersant's sources did not specify who lobbied for the restriction on the participation of foreigners.
Kommersant's sources consider it highly unlikely the government will adjust the terms.
The industry front-runner for Sukhoi Log is believed to be a consortium of the largest gold mining company in the Russian Federation, PJSC Polyus (which is controlled by Suleiman Kerimov's son, Said), and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July, the partners established a joint venture, CL Gold, which gives Polyus 51% of the shares, and the structure, Rostec RT-Global Resources, 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, while Polyus told Kommersant that ‘definitely, they are interested in the asset’ and possess all the necessary expertise and resources for its development.
ALROSA might participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the government of the Russian Federation, said Kommersant's sources.
Sergei Kashuba, Chairman of the Russian Union of Gold Producers, told Kommersant in December 2015, that investments in Sukhoi Log were valued at between $2.5 and 4 billion.
The majority of potential bidders are deterred not only by the investment amount, but also by the complexity of the project: extensive in-mine exploration of reserves and methods for working with complex ores are required, Kommersant's sources in the industry explain.
The launch of the merger of the four pension funds – KIT Finance, Promagrofond, Nasledie, and Gazfond Pension Savings – was reported yesterday by the 100% owner of the funds, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, LLC.
According to him, the approximate completion date for the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, NPF Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the compulsory pension insurance market.
However, the merger of this group was launched much later than its competitors.
For example, NPF Future, under the control of O1 Group, absorbed Stalfond back at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF is absorbing the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
‘Merging into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for solving structural problems’, notes the CEO of NPF Future, Nikolay Sidorov.
In 2017, NPF Doverie will join them.
If necessary, an entire issue can be redeemed by one big player’, says Yury Nogin, Director of the Financial Institutions Ratings Group at ACRA.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko could not be reached for comment.
Sergei Kolesnov, CEO of the consulting firm, Pension Partner, notes that Gazfond Pension Savings has fewer outflows, so the accession will help to stabilise the base of the group's other funds.
The Central Bank's requirements for the activities and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, so it is impractical to duplicate the infrastructure of the four funds given their unified investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.
The kindest Disney film, ‘Pete's Dragon’, has been released in Russia.
The beautiful views of New Zealand, the adorable dragon, the sentimental story, and the country music songs are enough to make one believe in good old-fashioned magic once again, says ELENA KRAVTSUN.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honour of a puppy from a book of fairy tales, plays tag with him, and falls asleep in his embrace.
Six years later, with a beard and in a loincloth, he is indistinguishable from that other clever forest rascal, Mowgli.
Even Gavin, who unleashes a hunt for the unusual inhabitant of the woods under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be anything but frightening, with the sweet muzzle of a bulldog, the wingspan of an airplane, and the power of invisibility.
While Robert Redford masterfully plays the iconic grandfather, whom literally every child would be glad to have.
Nothing short of a miracle would have helped.
The musical numbers and most of the odd jokes were thrown overboard.
Features drawn from ‘Bambi’, ‘E.T.’, and many other cherished children's films can be seen in this kind-hearted tale.
In fact, Director Lowry will get the keys to Disney's magic castle once again for an artistic film adaptation of the story of ‘Peter Pan’.
The tandem of David Lowery and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks, tried and tested during ‘Pete's Dragon’, has entered into an ambitious new project about the boy who never grew up from James Barrie's fairy tale by the same name.
We only learned that the prosecutor's office had made such a recommendation from investigators yesterday.
She related that the prosecutor's office pointed out to the investigators the discrepancy between the classification of the case and the materials collected.
As Kommersant reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
Kommersant-Boscosport correspondent, ALEXANDER ZILBERT, lived the life of an Olympic athlete in the Olympic Village, inspected Team Russia House, had lunch at the on-site cafeteria, and, after all of this, even passed a WADA test.
It seems that life here never stops for a second.
Even at night.
At first, no one was even showing up to clean.
Then, the cleaners started to show up, but only to spray some kind of substance on the floor, and that was all.
Their floors, can't you see, are somehow innovative.
Supposedly you can't wash them like a normal person.
Sure, we know these kinds of floors: ordinary laminate flooring!
In sum, we successfully managed to switch cleaning companies and now everything seems to be OK with this.
Two notices are hanging at the front desk: a printed one, ‘Please, do not throw paper in the toilet!’, and a hand-written one, ‘I will accept pins as gifts’.
The front desk itself is buried under pamphlets.
Their cheerful colours contrast with the titles of the brochures: ‘A guide to infectious diseases for travellers to Rio de Janeiro’; ‘First aid for drowning, choking on a foreign object, loss of consciousness - the steps of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation’; and ‘First aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures, and bleeding’.
The inside text is, generally speaking, reassuring.
However, not everyone can expect a favourable outcome.
Across from the medical centre is our delegation's headquarters.
And, of course, there is poetry:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
The fewer of us there are, the sweeter the taste of victory: Russia will not back down and will not be broken!
With the blessing of his Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeev will perform spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic Team.
And, in the darkness, I stumbled over bodies laying down on them.
By and large, there is nothing to complain about, the honoured coach of Russia shares his impressions. We live two to a room, the beds, of course, are almost right up against each other, but it's not critical.
There is one bathroom for four people, but at least it's spacious.
‘No, well, can you imagine it? They've run out of tea!’, tennis player, Svetlana Kuznetsova, who met me in the main dining room, says while throwing her hands up in dismay.
Here, they produce 60 thousand servings a day absolutely free of charge.
The last option, as I noticed, is very popular with our volleyball players.
Having said that, I couldn't find soup, for example, in any one of the areas of the giant restaurant.
It's a good thing I brought some Chinese tea to brew with me.
And a teapot.
But, in general, just so you understand, the food at the tennis courts is even worse.
Here, there is at least something to choose, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose the steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
I don't even understand why there is always such a queue at the local McDonald's.
The well-fed, relaxed, and, in a manner of speaking, ‘food drunk’ athletes are awaited at the restaurant exit by our best friends: representatives from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They cleverly entice with a quiz, the winner of which will receive a tee-shirt.
That is to say, I harnessed my patriotic impulse, of course.
I settled on option B: ‘No, I have one hour’.
Well, by the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation had become entirely critical.
But alas, they won't allow it!
That WADA doesn't play fair!
‘So, how's it going, Russia?’, the presenter of the quiz mockingly questions.
I got caught up with counting the fitness machines.
But maybe that's the way it should be?
However, one of our boys was sitting at the medical clinic located nearby.
In line to see the optometrist.
Don't worry; he's not a shooter.
It is inscribed with an inspiring appeal: ‘Celebrate with a condom!’
Then, you just have to turn a piece of metal resembling the knob of a door lock, and a condom, made of natural latex from the Amazon, readily falls from the device.
I took one for myself, as a memento.
Here, incidentally, by some sort of strange set of circumstances, my eyes are sore from all these boys in yellow and blue.
A team that never stops playing around, it turns out.
But, if you walk and don't get a ride in the electric cars, you will discover Team Canada House with a moose at the entrance and a pavilion with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundromat, and a dry cleaners, and a hair salon, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a post office with unique stamps (only you won't be able to wait out the queue of Chinese stamp collectors anyways), and a bank, and a lost and found, and a photo booth.
And in the late evening you, exhausted, will sit down beside an olive tree, decorated with multicoloured ribbons in memory of the athletes' dearly departed friends and relatives.
That is to say, about the Olympic movement.
While the rest of the Russian world watched with bated breath as the Australians came close to trouncing the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
I may even be the only Muscovite who saw how it unfolded, except, of course, for those who were watching the competition that night in Carioca.
Only a true fan could understand.
Just imagine: it's the dead of the night in Moscow.
In the kitchen, the faucet is leaking: there hasn't been time to drive to the market and buy a new one like the plumber requested.
I, of course, was counting on Match: the whole evening the young man on the news broadcasts had been shouting first about the great semi-final between Deriglazova and Shanaeva, and then about the impending battle for the gold.
But instead of this, it was basketball between the USA and Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything bad about this decision.
That's all well and good, but the bout with Di Francisca is drawing near and nothing is changing on the screen.
I start flipping through the channels in a slight panic.
There is no fencing on any of the specialty Match channels.
But, I have a feeling that the bout is just about to start.
It turns out that the First Channel website broadcasts the technical videostream of all events in real time.
I click on fencing and get the battle for the gold.
Deriglazova mounts a terrific counterattack, moves ahead in points, and, quite obviously, starts to run out the clock.
Di Francisca lunges at Deriglazova and the latter retreats; time is running out and the Italian makes a play.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic messenger on my phone notifies me of the fourth gold medal.
As it turns out, I am the first to see it with my own eyes.
The administrative body states that this ‘in no way infringes’ on the rights of Muslims of other ethnicities.
Yesterday, a plenum of the MRB of Tatarstan unanimously adopted a decision to hold Friday sermons in the Republic's mosques in the Tatar language only.
As stated by the Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin, this should become an incentive to young Tatars ‘to learn their native language’.
‘For those who will say that it is “difficult”, we intend to organise absolutely free Tatar language lessons at each of the large mosques’, Mr Samigullin promised.
An imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, ‘can use them to thoroughly prepare’.
The MRB of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand congregations throughout all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the mufti, in the regions, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
In particular, as indicated by the mufti, this was the practice at Burnaevskaya Mosque, Zakabannaya Mosque, and at ‘Eniler’.
However, Mr Mukhametshin emphasised that the leadership has made it an objective that all students are proficient in both official languages of the Republic, regardless of ethnicity.
‘This has absolutely nothing to do with infringing on the rights of non-Tatar Muslims’, emphasised Mr Mukhametshin, explaining that the sermon itself ‘is not a mandatory main part of namaz’.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was never a serious threat of the Tatar language vanishing from mosques.
The imams interviewed by Kommersant who were conducting sermons in Russian, are ready to follow the decision by MRB, however, they believe that the congregation will have difficulty understanding the clerics.
Both Tatars and Russians attend mosque.
‘We're going to have to change our ways’, says the Imam of Burnaevskaya Mosque, Farhat Mavletdinov.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
‘That is why we switched to the Russian language four years ago’, the imam says.
But we will abide by the decision of the plenum.
Simply, the results of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
The former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) has been taken to court
The capital’s prosecutor's office referred the criminal case against the former director of the FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise (FSUE), Centre for Information Technology and Communications of the Federal Penitentiary Service (TSITOS), Victor Opredelenov, to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles ended up in the accounts of the Samara branch of the FSUE, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
Footballer Hakan Şükür is suspected of involvement in the coup.
A star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Şükür is wanted by authorities in connection with the coup attempt that took place last month.
The forward, who ended his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to ‘an armed terrorist group’.
This is in reference to the Hizmet Movement: a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious and opposition leader, Fethullah Gülen.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to investigators, in addition to Hakan Şükür, his father was also part of Fethullah Gülen's organisation.
However, neither the former football player, nor his relatives were there.
As a football player, Hakan Şükür defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent the better part of his career with Galatasaray.
Hakan Şükür still holds the title for highest-scoring striker on Turkey's national team: he has 112 matches for the national team under his belt and scored 51 goals.
They are accused of aiding the military coup and having ties to the oppositionist Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen, who is living in the United States.
It bears reminding that, on 1 July, the Tavrida All-Russian Educational Youth Forum started working in Crimea.

Kommersant-News: The new general contractor promises to deliver Zenit Arena by 26 December.
The company, Metrostroy, which is the new general contractor for the stadium under construction in Saint Petersburg that is slated to host matches for the 2017 Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, promises to deliver the arena by 26 December, reports RIA Novosti, with reference to Head of the Temporary Commission of the Federation Council on preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Vadim Tyulpanov.
Vitaly Mutko and I were impressed by what we saw and heard’, the agency quotes its source as saying.
Mr Tyulpanov also stated that the Federation Council Commission headed by him would continue to monitor the progress of construction of the stadium and would regularly visit the construction site.
To recap, yesterday, it came to light that the company, Metrostroy, would complete construction of Zenit Arena; the value of the contract amounts to approximately 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won the bid for the improvement of areas around the stadium, with a contract value of 2.4 billion roubles. The contracts with JSC Corporation Transstroy, JSC Engineering Corporation Transstroy-SPB, and JSC Engineering Corporation Transstroy were terminated.
For more information about the choice of the new general contractor, read the following Kommersant material: ‘Metrostroy has been let onto the pitch’.
In Miass (Chelyabinsk Region), Konstantin Akulich, the lawyer for the former Vice Governor, Nikolai Sandakov, has been detained.
Another lawyer for the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, told Kommersant-South Ural that Konstantin Akulich was summoned to the Miass branch of the Investigative Committee of Russia today for arraignment on a year-old battery case.
At that time, Konstantin Akulich arrived at the scene of a traffic accident, in the capacity of a lawyer, to assist one of the parties to the accident.
‘Initially, it was filed against unidentified persons. Then, after he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulich’, says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulich became the ex-vice governor's lawyer at the beginning of August.
To recall, two criminal cases were brought against Nikolai Sandakov.
For more information about Mr Sandakov, read the following Kommersant material: ‘Former vice governor requests the consolidation of his cases’.
The Karabash copper smelter was founded by an English joint-stock company, headed by Leslie Urquhart, in 1910.
In 1998, a decision was made to resume operations at Karabash copper smelter.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone.
This was recently noted by Boris Dubrovsky, Governor of Chelyabinsk Region, who visited Karabashmed in the first days of July.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
And this is just for the first year.
RMK confirmed that, in 2015, the tax paid by the Mikheevsky Mining and Processing Plant was close to 1 billion roubles.

The Ministry of Interior of Thailand has blamed local saboteurs for explosions at resorts.
According to law enforcement officials, they have still not been able to ascertain whether any of these explosions are connected.
According to the primary theory, their organisers were attempting to disrupt tourist season.
It cannot be ruled out that Muslim separatists from the south of the country are behind the explosions.
Law enforcement agencies have already detained several people.
At the moment, it is known that there are four dead and several dozen wounded.
The country's Prime Minister, Prayut Chan-ocha, has ordered the implementation of additional security measures to prevent further explosions and rule out additional victims.
The devices were detonated at police stations on the island of Phuket, and in the cities of Surat Thani (the capital of the province of the same name, within which the island of Koh Samui is located) and in Hua Hin.
One day earlier, on 11 August, two explosions occurred in the resort town of Hua Hin.

The FAS has fined Google almost half a billion roubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile applications market.
The antitrust proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The FAS has confirmed these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced manufacturers of mobile devices to install other apps alongside the Google Play store.
Following the results of the inquiry, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to penalise Google, said Alexey Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including multinationals, must comply with the law on the protection of competition.
However, Google refused to agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been involved in litigation.
The FAS has noted that, in spite of the fine, they are discussing the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement with Google.
The current course of action is leading nowhere.
The 30-year-old thief managed to sell the stolen household appliances.
The press service of the regional Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior of Russia told a correspondent from MK in Volgograd that, yesterday evening, a resident of a satellite town contacted the police department with a statement about the robbery.
The man told the guardians of the law that an unknown man was leasing a flat from him.
When the owner went to check on his dwelling, he found it completely empty: no washing machine, no television, no fridge, not even the tenant.
It turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed Volga Region resident.
The man was arrested and he confessed, stating that he had already managed to sell the stolen property.
Now he will have to answer for the theft to the fullest extent of the law: a criminal case has been opened in relation to the man in custody.

A terrible accident occurred yesterday evening, in the area of the Kiziltash tract on the Crimean Peninsula.
The press service for EMERCOM of Russia in Volgograd Region reported to MK in Volgograd that the commuter bus carrying passengers was travelling along the P-29 Sudak-Feodosia route at 5:05 p.m.
All of a sudden, the vehicle veered into a ditch and fell over a cliff.

And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.
For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."
The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.
Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.
The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.
India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.
She is on a roll.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.

And then there is Logan Dooley.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.
Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke, and long may it reign.
This may be a regional ignorance.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.
The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning "diving board."
Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
This single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears.
From this, trampoline offers a respite.

Is Ethiopia about to crack?
In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.
Ethiopia's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip.
But that may be changing.
A generation is protesting.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.
The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.
Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
But that is changing as well.
"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."
While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The coffee is still good, too.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.
Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.
After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.
He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.

Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space.
There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed.
A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
Mr. Coe grimaced.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.
Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.
"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He was fabulously out of touch.
President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.
The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.
"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.
Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
The detention of defendants in the case of a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery has been extended to 14 November
Presnensky Court is keeping defendants in the case of a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery in detention until 14 November, having granted a corresponding request from investigators.
There are 14 defendants in this case.
This was announced on 12 August, by Deputy Prime Minister, Olga Golodets, during a visit to Bryansk Region.
Kamensky and Grigoryan made it into the final of the smallbore rifle shooting competition.
TASS reports that Sergei Kamensky earned 629 points and took first place: this is a new Olympic record for the qualifying round.
Kirill Grigoryan was second with 628.9 points.
Only the top eight athletes made it into the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish oppositionist, Fethullah Gülen, calls for an international investigation into the circumstances surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey.
Gülen, however, wholeheartedly denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organisation has never aspired to political power.
Earlier, the Istanbul Court issued an in absentia arrest warrant for the oppositionist Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S. backed forces say they have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
They had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.
"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.
Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.

Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
One whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.
A last resort is a launcher that shoots a Roman candle firework into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in July of this year have still not returned to Turkey.
This information was presented by Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, in a discussion with local journalists.
Country authorities officially announced that the coup had failed, and also reported the arrest of more than six thousand people, including senior and mid-level military officials.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey, 290 people were killed as a result of the coup attempt.
Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.
Lanzmann wrote.
The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."
The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.
The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.
That needs no explanation.
The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.
The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.
Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the scientific production association for the next three years.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event from the perspective of restoring order in the industry.
Currently, Almaz is working on the development of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus ADMSs, which are slated to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers, and cruisers.
According to the information I'm receiving, over several years of testing, there hasn't been a single truly successful test.
Granted, as far as I can gather, Almaz is not entirely to blame for this, Kornev said.
Kornev noted that the failure to meet delivery deadlines for the projects could be both a pretext and the reason for the dismissal.
This suggests that the head of Almaz was, perhaps, an obstinate figure, and resisted an ‘order’ issued from above.
It would appear that the state no longer intends to put up with such behaviour.
At the same time, the Russian leadership is aiming to punish managers who have been caught stealing (fraud at the Zvezda shipyard).
The President is personally paying greater attention to problems in this sector.
You get the impression that the President has taken to heart the famous expression: ‘If you want peace, prepare for war’.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.
They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.
Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.
There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.
We all as a team came together in the last three months.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.
You get to win it with your mates.
It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.
Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."
Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."
But dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point.
She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.
From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.
Donald Trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."
The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.
"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.
The company is going after ad blockers on desktop however, because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.
They're spinning as fast as they ever will.
At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.
Two agencies are conducting an investigation into the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea, Kommersant writes.
As previously reported, a confession was made by Evgeny Panov, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armyansk, the oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields as potential targets for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that far from all of the saboteurs' accomplices have been apprehended.
This, in particular, served as grounds for arrest of the suspects at the Kiev District Court in Simferopol, the publication notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov has become the head coach of the Russian national football team
The contract with him will last for two years, until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On 11 August, the Executive Committee of the RFU appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and that it will last two years.
It's known that Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintaras Staučė, and Vladimir Panikov will be part of his coaching staff.
The coach himself stated that he considers creating a competitive environment on the team as a matter of priority and is going to give the football players an opportunity to prove themselves.
Recall that the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was previously held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching the CSKA club.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even elementary schools require tuition fees.
In Namibia, however, education in primary schools is free.
The country's leaders are also actively working on other important areas.
Namibia also has the highest rating for freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is significantly ahead of the United States and other wealthy countries.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia manages to maintain high growth rates.
Of course, Namibia still has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional assessment methods, still remains quite high at almost 28%.
However, Namibia never thought of giving up; the country is dealing with the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after attaining independence, the authorities got to work on creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
As the head of state, Hage Geingob, noted, the media often says things he doesn't like.
Its achievements deserve international recognition and emulation.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunatsite is located inland, near the village of Yunatsite in Pazardzhik District.
The bead is made from a gold band rolled into a ring.
Obviously, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters news agency: ‘I am absolutely sure that the Yunatsite gold is older than the Varna gold’.
This is a discovery of extraordinary importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it is big enough to take its rightful place in history.
This will help to date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatsite is a well-known settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Currently, Tell Yunatsite is considered to be the most ancient ‘city’ in Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
In the local historiography, there is a special name for this archaeological community: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements started to emerge around the metalworking centres.
The excavation of Tell Yunatsite has been underway since 1976.
The remains of a fortress wall, which, at one time, reached a height of three metres, were discovered.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the ‘Bird City’: dozens of clay bird figurines were found here.
The ‘Bird City’ was destroyed around 4100 BC, possibly by Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
The three-metre-high fortress walls didn't stop them.
It is logical that something had to precede the golden luxury of Varna: something like a tiny gold bead created in Tell Yunatsite.
Porsche has artificially aged the 911 Targa model
It is equipped with a 3.0-litre, six-cylinder turbocharged engine, producing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
Facebook and ad blockers have unleashed an ‘arms race’
AdBlock Plus has released an ‘antidote’, but Facebook plans on making even this useless before long.
So, AdBlock Plus advertised their new technology, which is unlikely to remain effective for long
In this way, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of ‘arms race’, trying to one-up each other: the aggrieved party turned out to be the users, who missed interesting posts from their friends or saw advertisements where they weren't used to seeing them.
A rapist will stand trial in Murmansk · Vecherniy Murmansk.
The charges filed against the 54-year-old man are very serious: the commission of sexual battery.
The investigation established that, at the end of November 2015, the accused committed sexual battery against a 20-year-old young woman in the vicinity of Pavlov Street in Murmansk. A criminal case, with an approved indictment, has been submitted for consideration on merits.
Another new model announced for Russia is the Rich New pickup truck.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossvan, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (slightly less than 550 thousand roubles at the current exchange rate).
At a similar price, the Rich New will surely be of interest to Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Currently, Dongfeng's Russian line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending tax assessment notices.
The latter can be obtained in-person at any tax office (regardless of place of registration).
But the controversial concept did not confound the experts at the company, G-Power, who tackled the redesign of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
To beef up the ‘muscles’ of this crazy ‘Gelik’, the experts took advantage of the benefits offered by the 5.5-litre supercharged V8 engine.
In the coming years, the debut of at least four new eco-friendly models is expected.
