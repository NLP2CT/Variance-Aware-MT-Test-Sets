Here, while looking back at May to August which started the first half of the Olympic race for a spot in the Tokyo Olympics, we look forward to the men's' singles in the upcoming mid-way games (September through December). (Text/Badminton Magazine editorial department)
In the first half, the two athletes who were able to stay in promising condition were Momota Kento, who won 2 of the 4 tournaments, and Chou Tien-chen from Taiwan.
Though this number is small compared to other top athletes, it is a schedule that puts less strain on his body.
Ace of Taiwan, strong in consecutive matches.
Until last year Chou Tien-chen gave an impression of lacking in explosive power, but since this year there has been an increased sense of stability in his plays and he has been able to maintain solid good performance.
Other athletes besides these two that showed results in the first-half games were the young Thai ace, Kantaphon, and India's B. Sai Praneeth.
He still has some rough spots, but the twenty year-old (will turn twenty-one on the 18th) who has grown able to rally equally with top athletes could be said to be a force hiding a large potential to jump into the Olympic race.
Also, B. Sai Praneeth has stepped out of India, which has many strong singles players.
Sameer Verma, Prannoy H.S., and Srikanth Kidambi who is lagging due to an injury, are likely to catch up, and we should turn our attention to the Indian athletes in from mid-games forward.

On September 26th the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 hospitals that have been deemed "of poor medical practice" out of 1455 public hospitals including Japanese Red Cross, and other government-run hospitals nationwide.

Targeted hospitals made up 29.1% of the total, and many were hospitals that had a comparatively low number of beds.
In order, Nigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43.3%) had the highest percentages by prefecture.
By target numbers Hokkaido had the highest with 54, while Okinawa was the only with zero.

Hypothesizing Komagatake eruption, first prefecture comprehensive disaster prevention training in 18 years spreads with residents participation (Video): Hokkaido Shimbun, Digital Edition

Free agent Honda Keisuke approaches Man U publicly!
The astonishing truth is revealed
So why did Honda make this spectacular request to one of the Premier League's most powerful clubs?
The answer lies in an article published by the Australian version of FOX Sports on the 24th.
Honda was named, along with players such as Hatem Ben Arfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfried Bony.
United is currently in a state of emergency after a spate of injuries to their players, including midfielder Paul Drogba, defender Luke Shaw, defender Eric Bailly, forward Anthony Martial and forward Marcus Rashford.
The "Red Devils", who are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r, have had a difficult start to the league with only two wins and 22 losses, and are facing issues in the quality of their frontline.
It goes on to say that his nine goals scored in 18 games with Melbourne Victory was a "solid record", but points out that "Honda, 33, has to step away from his pastime of managing the Cambodian national team to earn full attention."
Will Honda's approach bear any fruit?
It will be interesting to see if United make a move for the veteran who has declared it his aim to take part in next year's Tokyo Olympics.
Currently, the lending locations include 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.
Naka-ku, Hamamatsu city accounts for 60%.
It can be accessed from the website of Lake Hamana Sightseeing Area.
"Hopefully, this will lead to new foreign customer development despite of the difficult business environment," the Chamber of Commerce spokesperson said.
In his 7th year of professional golf, the 24-year-old has a diminutive stature at 1.66m, but he is currently seventh in terms of driving distance (hitting an average of 304.02 yards).
"It can be used for holes where the line of sight is downhill."
Apparently, the trick is to "swing the club level".

Garcia's Wedge Shot
I was able to make it to some extent in the first half, so I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, but I just couldn't get the putter to go well and couldn't make it further, so that was frustrating.
-- Could you see a victory with the eagle in the sixth and the birdie in the seventh?
I got the birdie on the 7th and there was a chance, but I regret that in the end I couldn't make it in the second half.
Recently my condition (of my shot) hasn't been good so it was good that I could keep solidly to the fairway even on a course where it was narrow.
There wasn't much else different besides that, but because it was a joint sponsored tournament with few Japanese athletes, I approached the match with the sentiment "I can't lose to the overseas players!"
The second half will start, but I can't aim for the top prize if I don't win one or more so I want to get one more win, and the ZOZO Championship is also coming up so to qualify I also want to do my best to get in the top ranks in the tournaments leading up to it.
How to prevent dementia and keep it at a merely "forgetful" stage?
Interview and story by Watanabe Yo
Dementia never fully goes away
A cure or prevention for dementia has been long-awaited, but what is the current state of progress?
Otsuki: As we age, it's possible for anyone to suffer from dementia, though there are varying degrees of severity, from mild to quite serious indeed.
Are there any kinds of people who are more prone to dementia, or who are less likely to get it?
Otsuki: Even if dementia is not completely avoidable, it is possible to suppress the symptoms to the extent that it is nothing more than forgetfulness.
Dementia is considered a lifestyle-related disease and there are certain trends among people who are more prone.
Dementia is treated as a lifestyle-related disease.
They can be used by people who live in an environment where they cannot cook in the first place, because they don't have gas or electricity.
This results in a diet that is low in vegetables and protein, leading to an unbalanced lifestyle that is high in fat and sugar.
A woman (age 52) from Itami City in Hyogo Prefecture remarked "When I turned to the left, I saw the scenery on the left, and when I turned right I saw to the right, and it really felt like I was walking inside. If I have a chance I would like to experience the real Maki-do Cave."
