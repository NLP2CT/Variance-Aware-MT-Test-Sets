In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
Lamb grew up in the area.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.
Police said the dog was OK.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
I mean, they both had a good sense of wit about them.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
Classes resume Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.

Toys R Us Plans to Hire Fewer Holiday Season Workers
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at stores and distribution centers around the country, down from the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
It was noteworthy because of personal reasons, too.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it dawns on me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."

8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
The only candidate who beats him?
A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.

Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals border, detains migrants
But frustrations were on the rise.
Some refused food and water in protest.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.
Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't impacted their overall views of her.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do the best on honesty.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
But Carson rocketed in that same period from 6% to 23%.
The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
He could not be revived and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.
What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.
As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside pure stock plays, consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar.

Delta State University shooter left note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.

Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you everyone for your messages, words can't describe how gutted I am, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."

If any player goes off with this kind of injury, everybody is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.
PSV's AndrÃ©s Guardado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Smalling.

Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.
I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.
He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.

Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.

'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.

Eight golden rules for living in student halls
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, whether and where you took a gap year, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.

Introverts get a raw deal at university.
That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I've expended on interacting with you."
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your housemates will feel obliged to chat, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Double check with the milk owner.

In the exhilarating moment you realise someone's left their keys inside their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems.

EYES ON IRAN
When we return to this week, we witness a very different scenario.
For this reason, all the eyes are on Iran.
This may cause the price to fall below even the surprising levels of today.
As long as we do not see any permanent pricing above the 32-33 dollar-level, the upward movement of oil prices may remain limited and the downward pressure on prices may increase.
In this situation, it should be no surprise if it is seen that there is a loosening of the support level of 23.30-25.60 in the lower end.

Who was the most legendary angel? - Karolina Kurkova.
I am not talking about her gorgeous physique: She is so positive and she is such a good girl!
While working, she sat beside me and said "Are you hungry, honey?" and gave me an apple, etc.
In a word, she was so sweet.
You also know what I am talking about, I looked into you and discovered that you have done lots of interviews with all the models of Victoria's Secret.
Karolina is so beautiful, isn't she?
But Adriana Lima also impressed me with her beauty...
Her voice, her intonation...
It stresses you after a while and you say, "Sit somewhere and look beautiful; do nothing else!"
I done an interview with Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life but I was astonished by her empty-headedness.
- Most of them are like that.

It was quite hard to work with her though.
She used to come backstage and smoke like a chimney.
Nobody can smoke you see, only she can smoke!

But she had such a beautiful face in the nineties.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot's.
She represents the end of the supermodel era.

They published a disrespectful cartoon about our honourable Prophet.
Having stirred up different reactions on social media, the cartoon is part of a column consisting of 4 frames.
On the other hand, the cartoon caused many people to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
It was said in the cartoon "the goal was too close" and "two children's menus for the price of one" was written in the advertising poster.

What are the benefits of steam cooking?
A technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals in food, steam cooking is becoming increasingly popular.
Substances found in foods such as protein, cellulose and starch completely disolve using this technique, making the food softer.
Taking place in low pressure, steam cooking is done in a cooking pot with the help of steam pots or steam machines.
Both the amount of water used and the cooking time is less when cooking at high pressure.
The best example of this is cooking in a pressure cooker.
One-third of a deep cooking pot is filled with water and a steam strainer is placed inside the pot.
The mouth of the cooking pot is half closed.
In this way, we allow steam to escape from the cooking pot.
The cooked vegetables are removed from the oven and served on plates.
Appearance, colour and aroma of the food do not change with the steam cooking technique; therefore this is a healthy method.
The distinctive taste of the food stays the same.
Therefore the quality and flavour of the food are not spoiled.
Loss of nutrition is kept to a minimum in steam cooking, which is also the most economical way of cooking.
Steamed vegetables offer a satisfactory flavour for the diner with their fresh and vibrant appearance.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The alien's "last album"
Knowing that you will die; producing that final album without telling anyone; making your deathbed an artistic expression in the music video you shot...
I say mortal earthlings because I am among those who believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came to our world from some corner of the universe; now he has returned to his motherland; which is just how it goes.
He fulfilled his duty with success.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99 TL 5/5
Maybe he was nourished by Warhol and Kubrick from the same planet as him.
Actually he did not join us; he was always ahead of us.
Thanks to him, many people found their way.
Both musicians and listeners...
He was not a man; he was not a woman; he was not "human".
He was a body.
One more final hand...
It is an album neither of death nor a "reckoning with the past"...

A price increase of 25 kuruÅ on bread in Ankara and Istanbul
However, 250g of bread was selling for 1 TL yesterday in the capital, Ankara.
"It was a price decision taken 2 years ago."
The Chamber of Merchants' union decided on this price 2 years ago.
It is a price implemented throughout Turkey.
There is no price increase.

Bloody terror attack this time in Burkina Faso
Al Qaeda's North Africa branch claimed responsibility for the attack.

If we say this, then terror will win...
We used the expression "standing firm".
According to the report from Defense One, the organization is benefiting from a new messaging application for messaging inside the organization.
The application allows the organization to cipher messages and share media among themselves.
A surprising move from ISIL in Iraq
According to Ghost Security Group, functionality of the application is "primitive" in comparison with such popular applications as Whatsapp and Telegram.
For this reason, the organization has now started to use its own solutions rather than relying on the ciphering of Whatsapp and Telegram.

How to use the mid-term break?
Write down everything you plan to do, and try to put it into practice.
You can be sure that you will benefit from this and have a more efficient term.
Deal with Your Incomplete Subjects: Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective method of eliminating this tendency to forget is by doing revision.
Solve Questions:
Do not forget to select a number of questions to be solved each day.
Solve Mock Exams:
Supposing that you finished a Turkish lesson, you can solve a 40-question mock exam of Turkish.
Vacation and Hobby Plans:
Of course, a break does not only mean studying for lessons, you should spare a few days for vacation, to rest and spend time on your hobbies.
Nevertheless, you should firstly decide on and believe this.
Now, the only thing you should do is look forward and let go of the past, and run instead of walking.
To summarize what we said:
3) Finish any incomplete subjects,
6) Read books,
7) Determine new goals for next term,

"Kervan will also expand abroad".
Kervan's total retail area, with 45 stores in 35 provinces, is 45 thousand square metres.
There are around 500 people employed by Kervan.
From the very beginning, we created a brand with the support of Mr. Åinasi.
We learned a lot from him as well.
KalaycÄ±oÄlu explained that there are 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad, most of which are in the Middle East; and they started exports to China last month.
KalaycÄ±oÄlu said, "We opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We agreed with a chain store which has 200 stores.
Moskalevsky confirmed, "Yes, we put the factory on sale."
YÄ±ldÄ±z Holding becomes Pladis abroad
YÄ±ldÄ±z Holding combined all the acquired global companies, active in the biscuit and chocolate sectors, under the name "Pladis".
Speaking at a meeting related to the merger of the global companies within YÄ±ldÄ±z Holding, Murat Ãlker, YÄ±ldÄ±z Holding's Chairman, said, "To be a global company was our target from the beginning" and added:
Murat Ãlker broadcast the 335 million Turkish lira sale live on Periscope
Founded 72 years ago, this company is now proceeding under the name "YÄ±ldÄ±z Holding" and becoming a global brand, a global company around the world in the business of biscuits, chocolate and confectionery.
In this period, we have advanced in various branches of the industry from retailing to packaging, from real estate to personal care in addition to biscuits, chocolate and confectionery.
We are now re-evaluating our company structure and getting reorganized.
We have divided the world into regions.
Mehmet, Mohammed and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet TÃ¼tÃ¼ncÃ¼ is responsible for Turkey, the Middle East, North Africa and Turkic Republics.
Murat Ãlker sold a share in SAF Real Estate Investment Trust
He continued, "We are promising happiness to the whole world in every bite", Murat Ãlker said, "The name of our global firm is Pladis, which we established to make this promise real."
He said, "If you ask from where the name Pladis comes, actually the name has no special meaning" and added:
Aztecs called it Maya.
Japanese people, Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
SÃ¼reyya in Arabic; we gained inspiration from the name of the star cluster, Pleiades, which is made up of seven stars and means Ãlker in Latin.
Vice Chairman of the Board of YÄ±ldÄ±z Holding, Ali Ãlker, underlined that they "started to create a synergy in innovation" by collaborating with laboratories in different countries, and added:
We have 27 R&D centres under Pladis.
The biggest ones are in the United Kingdom and Turkey.
More than 300 R&D specialists are working here.
Synergy projects have already started to produce results.
Another example of synergy: Ãlker Krispi TÄ±rtÄ±klÄ±, which are the same products but with different brands.
By adapting cracker technology developed in the United Kingdom, namely the product Jacob's Crinklys, into Turkey in a short time, we brought the pleasant taste to Turkey under the name Ãlker Krispi TÄ±rtÄ±klÄ±.

Kemal KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu was elected as General President again
Kemal KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu was elected as the general president again in the regular congress.
Receiving the votes of 990 delegates out of 1238, KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu became general president again.
248 of the votes cast were declared null and void.
CHP had 1275 delegates in total.
In the congress, KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu stated the following in his summary:
We would have liked people to dance and sing folk songs here.
The resulting atmosphere overshadows all of that.
Terror is a crime against humanity and the terrorists should not be forgiven.
The fight against terrorism is carried out with intelligence, knowledge and comprehension.
When they came to the table, they made serious mistakes.
The government is responsible for all the bloodshed, tears and victims.
Who is responsible for them?
The taxi driver Åehmuz in DiyarbakÄ±r?
We will participate genuinely in the meetings to change the coup d'etat laws, we will offer our opinions.
We won't let anybody build a country on their personal views.
I say, "Let's change the pro-coup mindset".
There are parts of what they say we do not agree with, but people should be able to offer their opinions freely.
I would also like to ask him; those who benefit from the state, and use all the opportunities of the state, why don't they think about it when they rob the country?
CHP is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country.
We will make preparations together for the fourth biggest revolution.
They may detain us, they may take us into custody; CHP will bring freedom to this country no matter what they do, no matter how heavy the price.
I'm making a clear, straight call to you, DavutoÄlu.
You gave a meritorious service medal to someone who gave a warning to you.
Which coup are you talking about?
It is completely aimed at deceiving the people.
There is a President's oath in article 103.
If someone comes out and gives this promise, they should keep their word to the death.
Because honesty and honour are indisputable for us.
What do you understand from honesty and honour, why did you take this oath?
What do honesty and honour mean to you?
It does not suffice and they want the presidential system.
Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?
One person commands and everybody does what is necessary.
Do we have a healthy parliament in Turkey that works?
No, it does not work.
If we bring libertarian democracy, the system will work.
Istanbul deputy GÃ¼lay YedekÃ§i arrived early and sat near the section allocated to the General President KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu instead of sitting in the area allocated to the deputies.
One of the things most spoken about in the backstage of the congress was the conversation between KlÄ±Ã§daroÄlu and the Yalova deputy Muharrem Ä°nce.
Ãzcan said, "How can I know about the conversation between two people."
KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu's son applauded his "father" repeatedly.
After his speech at the congress, KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu went to his home and started to work on the list of party council.
Vice Chairman of the AK Party SelÃ§uk ÃzdaÄ, Ä°dris Baluken from HDP and Ruhsar Demirel from MHP watched the congress.
AK Party member ÃzdaÄ and the delegation from the AK Party left the hall when KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu harshly criticized President ErdoÄan.
ÃzdaÄ said, "I saw that he knows no boundaries of criticizing, it was not possible for me to accept it".
Berkin Elvan's mother GÃ¼lsÃ¼m and father Sami Elvan also participated in the congress.
Participation was high.
The most exciting moment was the moment in which KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu.
The excitement continued when the KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu couple greeted the hall with a wave.
There was a lot of movement in the ground area of the arena even when KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu was making speech.
The CHP congress has one more difference from the congresses of the AK Party or MHP.
In these parties, only the general president talks.
When the number of party members wanting to speak increased, Council Chairman Murat KarayalÃ§Ä±n had difficulty in adjusting the time.
When KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu went up to the rostrum, we journalists waited for his answer to the question "What should be done".
Firstly, KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄlu answered the question "what is going on".
He stressed that all of these problems could be overcome with a stronger democracy and more justice.
"We will struggle to the death for democracy".

The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Settings app, tapping "General," and then selecting "Software Update."
If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
It's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charger while the update happens, so that it doesn't run out of battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't let the update go ahead, since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking.
FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there's an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further," she said.
There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be, and they have almost no data to rely on that post-dates the developments in China," Oliner said.
But, in effect, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
There's even an automotive section if you need to pick up some motor oil.
The store is massive, and it will take over an hour to comb through all the aisles.
LAX-C probably has it.
Items are reasonably priced, and a number of items are sold in bulk.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet fish, and even fry it for you if you'd like.
A good portion of the store is given over to the massive freezer section, where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork casings, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially-prepared foods and more.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts.
Parking: LAX-C has its own lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.

Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
However when asked the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's final rose?," their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one.
I've seen them together and they do have that chemistry there.

Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.
Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just worry about the next play and that's it," said Hayne.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
Weight loss operations, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
Meanwhile, the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-violence.
I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.
A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
It could have been very lethal for my child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.

Cruel fate is innocent
How humanist I am today.
But, how is it possible!
This world is cruel.
There is death in destiny.
Pain as well.
Alien invasion as well.
Lightning strikes as well.
Sometimes a crashing space shuttle.
Maybe a meteor.
Let's react.
Let's say cruel fate, what a disaster!
Let our humanism grow.
But it does not feel ashamed, god-damn it!
She was 3 months old.
She was with her grandfather.
They also killed him.
What can we say, cruel fate ! They killed Yusuf YaÄÄ±cÄ± in Silopi on January 3.
I suppose he was escaping from the aliens.
They riddled him with bullets while searching for a safe place.
One day after that, they killed Melek AlpaydÄ±n at her breakfast table in KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k AktarlÄ± street in DiyarbakÄ±r.
Several days later, the aliens burned the Sema ÃÄ±ngÄ±llÄ±oÄlu Primary School.
The same aliens attacked another school full of students with firearms.
3 children were killed in the ÃÄ±nar district of DiyarbakÄ±r two days ago.
An unidentified object killed these kids without pity with 1 ton of explosives.
There were other killed and wounded people.
Who is the culprit?
Fate, of course.
Cruel fate.
No, fate is not cruel.
Cruel fate is innocent!
The killer is walking around outside freely, looking at our faces and grinning.
While the killer is before our eyes, they create opportunities to escape instead of pointing at the killer.
Some people try to prevent this, they even try to put out the fire.
Civil war.
Inter-state war.

Selen UÃ§er directs the play in which Deniz ÃakÄ±r, Zeynep Kankonde, Ä°pek TÃ¼rktan Kaynak, Kadir Ãermik and Åebnem SÃ¶nmez play a part.
Then the curtain goes up.
Who she is and why she is trying to commit suicide are understood after the intervention of the next-door neighbours.
SHE LEFT A LETTER
There are some things that have accumulated inside her.
She decided to commit suicide, left a letter behind, but she cannot jump from the window.
They approach the situation as if it were a normal, ordinary situation.
The song "Sokak KÄ±zÄ±" by Nazan Ãncel is also used in the play.
COMEDY OF DEPRESSION
Zeynep Kankonde and Ä°pek TÃ¼rktan Kaynak carry the burden of comedy in the play.
The exaggerated characters played by this duo succeed in making the audience laugh with both their mimics and lines.
Making an indelible impression with his performance in Tolga Ãelik's award-winning film "SarmaÅÄ±k", Kadir Ãermik successfully accompanies these four women.
Defined as a comedy of depression, the one-act play promises to make you laugh without confusing the mind.
The woman is hanging in the air like an unrealised joke.
In fact, every story begins with a kind of being abandonment.
I should put my hands into my pocket, I cannot stand anything without pockets.
People do not know where to put their hands.

"Drink kefir and live longer"
It can be consumed safely at any age
It is rich in vitamin B1, B12 and K.
It is also a good source of phosphorous.
She said, "its nutritional value is high and it is a digestible drink".
Explaining that children, the elderly, expectant mothers and women entering the period of menopause can consume kefir without hesitation, the specialist dietician PÄ±nar Kural EnÃ§ said, "Kefir is originally a local drink made in the Caucasus."
Kefir is one of the most natural ways to protect babies from metabolic illnesses.
There are around 1.5-2 kilos of bacteria and fungus in our intestines.
Micro-organisms in the digestive system are divided into two groups: beneficial and detrimental ones.
Beneficial micro-organisms are called "probiotic micro-organisms".
The activities of probiotics have an important effect as much as our liver, and if they are consumed sufficiently they prevent detrimental micro-organisms in the intestines from sticking and spreading to the intestinal wall.
Impairment of the balance of healthy micro-organisms in the intestine causes disease.
The health of the digestive tract should be protected through proper nourishment.
To do this, we should certainly consume a sufficient amount of probiotics.
It enables the good bacteria and fungus in the intestines to reproduce healthily and to benefit us.
With regular use of kefir, the intestines will function, intestinal disorders will be resolved, bloating will be reduced, and healthier digestion will be obtained.
A healthy digestive system means a healthy and disease-free body.

All eyes will be on German footballer Mario Gomez in the match BeÅiktaÅ will play against Mersin Ä°dmanyurdu.
12 of the last 15 matches won
BeÅiktaÅ won 12 of the last 15 matches it played in the Super League.
"Scoring" and "conceding" teams face off
The match between BeÅiktaÅ and Mersin Ä°dmanyurdu will pit the highest scoring and the team that concedes most in this Super League season.
Having conceded 36 goals in a 17 week-period, Mersin Ä°dmanyurdu is one of two teams who concede most in the league alongside EskiÅehirspor, sharing last place on the rankings table.
Manager crisis in Mersin Ä°dmanyurdu
In the mid-season break there was a manager crisis experienced in Mersin Ä°dmanyurdu, who couldn't finish the first half of the Super League in their desired position.
An agreement was made with the manager Nurullah SaÄlam after the Mersin Ä°dmanyurdu general meeting, which held an extraordinary general meeting during the mid-season break and elected HÃ¼seyin ÃalÄ±Åkan as the president; but the 50 year-old manager remained at the head of the team for only 2 days.
Mesin Ä°dmanyurdu will take to the field against BeÅiktaÅ without a manager because they have not made an agreement with anyone after Nurullah SaÄlam.

Putin eats his words
The most widespread advice is to make online hotel reservations and to fly with Turkish Airlines.
In those days, our businessmen and our Turkish Airlines staff suffered a lot, trying to go to Russia in the usual way.
1 month, not much, passes from then till now, and Nerdun HacÄ±oÄlu reports from Moscow yesterday.
One way or another, sanctions are being eased one by one.
All right, but why?

Making a speech in a conference he participated in at the Hague, Koenders stated that Assad is responsible for the refugee influx.
Assad should be tried in the ICC in the Hague.

However, I am aware of the fact that Assad will not leave his post in the near future.
Rumour Mill: No Celtic disharmony
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to open up a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.

Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson comments
Neilson is sticking with what he said, insisting: "I didn't question any integrity, I didn't comment on a performance."
The incident happened in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "Safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it is playing for Celtic."

Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.
I cannot do that.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I won't go over all the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
Man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but did inspire locals to begin planning a tongue-in-cheek Ben Cousins biathlon.
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said.
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.
That really saddens me.
I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision.
It's against the rules of racing.
I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Wayne is talking about exciting footy.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.
That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.
He has clear connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.

Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.
He said he was doing it to lure them in.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
He was unhurt, but video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his address.
Last month, they booed and heckled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) chief whip Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Nr Mugabe's address.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-saving efforts at it enterprise services business.
HP is splitting into two listed companies later this year, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $2.7bn, beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
HP has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
It is nothing major.
This was just an accident.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
Jack is young enough to get over that.
HÃ©ctor BellerÃ­n and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
It has never been done at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006 but, on the other hand, I am long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in males than females.
In a bid to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.
And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.
Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends.
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship.
Or, better still, if in Starbucks you see someone alone, give a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG swat aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
The qualifiers are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a magnificent match from them.
The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share, which marked a 2.4-percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
It offloaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.

'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
He's received tons of accolades from fans.
He's such a great guy, and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed.
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.
"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.
Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses.
Guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.
The recent outstanding trend is those miniatures...
This point of view also applies to bags.
Only your telephone, credit card and keys fit inside these tiny bags.
Starting with CÃ©line and HermÃ¨s, the trend spread with Prada.
Loewe presented the fun bags it created in two sizes.
Fashion weeks led to the popularization of the mini-bag trend.
Since they are very small, it is not really possible to wear them on your arm.
They can be worn across the body with their long straps.
However, we saw these straps tangled around the wrists of the models on the podium.
Fendi is one of those taking the mini-bag theme one step forward.
How?
By transforming the mini-bags into a bag ornament that can be attached to bigger ones.
Let's see what else we will see!
Denim changes skin
Turkey is on a level that can compete with world brands in terms of denim.
The experience gained in production has been enriched with design.
The strong mood of leather complete with black pieces; chiffon long blouses and bright sweatshirts, provides a casual and chic appearance.
In the past, young people wore denim and wanted to be lost in the crowd.
It was thought that it would save the day.
A small step for Banksy, a giant step for the "Global"
A product of 15 years of work from the artist and gathering the originals of 85 works for the first time, the exhibition is the first in the Global KarakÃ¶y building .
The first exhibition by the mysterious street artist Banksy in Istanbul opened yesterday in the Global KarakÃ¶y (RÄ±htÄ±m Street).
We also don't know if he came to Istanbul or not.
It is not necessary to receive permission from him.
The exhibited works were partly collected from Lazaridas and collectors.
However, there are issues that Banksy fans are curious about.
What would Banksy think about the exhibition "The Art of Banksy" which brings together 85 of his works?
This is certainly not the style of Banksy.
They are despicable and cruel.
Let them dig ditches.
They are completely dark people.
They are cruel, they are despicable.
What do these dark academics think about those babies, 3-year old MevlÃ¼de who died a martyr with her father in the incident that occurred in ÃÄ±nar?
How can they allow their conscience to stand by her killers?
Yesterday, I said that all the necessary steps should be taken rapidly.
Let them do whatever they do out there.
If they want to do politics, let them do politics in parliament.
If they cannot do it in parliament, let them go and dig ditches or go to the mountains.
I am saying it clearly and explicitly.

The second documentary from Mete GÃ¼mÃ¼rhan, "Young Wrestler", 66th.
Mete GÃ¼mÃ¼rhan is originally from Edirne even though he was born and raised in the Netherlands.
He listened to stories about grease wrestling from his grandfather and watched competitions in Turkey, where he came during the summer when he was a child.
"There are not only political problems in Turkey."
I wanted to tell the world what is going on in Anatolia other than that.
"We stayed in a sugar factory"
The father of the children did not give permission to shoot a documentary.
GÃ¼mÃ¼rhan talked about how he overcame this challenge as follows: "I thought about what I could do all day long."
The father mentioned a boarding school in Amasya, where the children would go.
I thought of going there.
We did not even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the dormitory of a sugar factory."
He says, "They did not know Turkish either".
Young wrestlers focuses on the story of six of the 26 child wrestlers.
Mete GÃ¼mÃ¼rhan says of working with the children as follows: "I let them be completely natural."
I shot the training for the first one and a half weeks.
I wanted that the children act as if there were no camera.
"Fortunately they quickly adapted."
It was a surprise to be selected for Berlin
Young Wrestlers is not a sports documentary, it is a production that narrates the struggle of the children and a slice of their life.

The Screenwriters Association (SÄ°YAD) also made a statement and said, "We stand by the academics, who were made the target of a lynching campaign".
After this call, some universities fired the academics and the prosecution office brought an ex-officio prosecution.
I am your fan, please help me!
HÃ¼rrem Sultan's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin's hair...
Trying to look like celebrities is considered normal to some extent but it is regarded as a psychological disorder after the point that it starts to completely affect your life.
It is at such an extent that the following quote of useless information was read thousands of times: "Firstly, when you go to the hairdresser, have your hair cut at the sides, in other words, the part over and around your ears up to the upper part of your head."
However, the sides should be short.
After the cutting process is over, you should shape your hair lightly with water.
After the shaping process, fix your hair with the help of spray.
"It is necessary to shape it when it is wet to get Justin hair."
Fans of celebrities are considered as a "bundle of love".
In particular, it is much discussed that adolescents make decisions about what they eat and drink, what they listen to, what they wear in accordance with celebrities.
Excessive loyalty to people presented as unattainable, and taking them as role models is defined as a mental disorder.
Senior psychologist SÃ¼meyye Demir accepts that Turkey falls behind in terms of studies into this field.
This situation is now changing.
Fans jumping onto the emotional speed train
"Children also copy the negative things."
When we consult her about how we should approach them, SÃ¼meyye Demir starts by reminding us that the syndrome of celebrity worship is seen mostly in adolescence.
On one hand, we are complaining about the limitations of family and on the other hand we are facing young people expecting support and affection from them: "We are obliged to take into consideration their emotional ups and downs."
New research put forward that they are forced by the changes occurring in their brains.
It is possible to change behaviour
Senior psychologist SÃ¼meyye Demir, reminds us of the duties falling into the share of parents to overcome celebrity worship syndrome:
Never let them suppress their emotions.
Change your communication approach to the form of adult to adult.
Tell your child that errors are opportunities for change, and accept them as they are.
But unfortunately it is not perceived like this.
Furthermore, this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to narrow it down to a country or a continent.
Dr. Recai YahyaoÄlu draws attention to the fact that there are certain people that occupy the television in every country.
It is because they do not embrace this life or they do not dare to do it.
"However, both those who do not have the opportunities, and those who have the opportunities but do not live like them continue to watch them angrily."
Other advice from the senior psychologist SÃ¼meyye Demir is to question the reality of these lives.
We should not fail to notice that artificial lives are being talked about.

Should I undergo a cholecystostomy? - Family-Health News - Zaman Newspaper
I have gallstones, I have stomach ache when I get up every morning and after meals; and I visit the toilet 2 times or more everyday.
Could it prevent me from losing weight?
I have now started to use alkaline, but my appetite for meals hasn't diminished, I cannot lose any weight.
What should I do?
In your opinion, should I undergo a cholecystostomy?
ANSWER: Most of the time, an infection accompanies gallstones.
This complaint of stomach aches, occurring soon after meals, is a sign of the fact that your gallbladder tightens when you eat and you spill the infected gall into the intestines.
This is why you visit the toilet frequently.
Since you visit the toilet frequently and what you eat is expelled without being digested, losing weight becomes slower.
If you go to a gastroenterologist and the condition is detected as I said, you can be free from this condition by using antibiotics.
However, you may eventually have to undergo a cholecystostomy.
Alkaline probiotics may decrease your symptons but it does not cure them.
I advise you to use alkaline probiotics anyway.
Because this probiotic powder is the biggest help in losing weight.
I eat too much under stress
Dear sir, I eat continuously when I am stressed and angry; and I gain weight.
How can I cope with this?
Another reason is your failure to digest the food you eat.
To do this, your digestive system should work healthily.
If you do not have a problem such as an ulcer, reflux or similar problems, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic medicine.
You will greatly feel its benefits.
I cannot gain weight, doctors do not know the reason
Somehow I cannot gain weight.
The most important thing is I do not know why.
Doctors do not say anything either.
ANSWER: The techniques we apply are not intended for losing weight, but also regaining the physiological functions of the body and turning it into its ideal size.
You lose weight more when you eat sweets and pastries.
I imagine you might have understood this by now.
It is also possible for you to be stimulated with Carboxy therapy and gain weight through a healthy diet.
You will reach your ideal body by gaining weight, and they will do so by losing weight.
If the problem with the system is eliminated, you will gain weight, they will lose weight.
Nevertheless, firstly the system should work properly.
After that, the nominees were evaluated by the Women of the Year 2015 Jury consisting of HÃ¼lya KoÃ§yiÄit, Mehmet Y.YÄ±lmaz, ErtuÄrul ÃzkÃ¶k, Nihat OdabaÅÄ±, Aret Vartanyan, Leyla Alaton, Esin Ãvet, AyÅe Arman and Ahmet GÃ¼neÅtekin; the winners were then chosen.
There are some innate emotions in people's world of emotion.
Arslan continues with the following: "Maybe sometimes we can fail to meet the emotional needs (not stroking their hair, not hugging and kissing them, not caring about their school or other needs), and sometimes we can fail to meet also their physical needs (eating, drinking, shelter, school needs etc.)."
This is a growing attitude that opens the doors to anger and hatred.

Åavluk said, "There is no judicial remedy now."

The Arbitration Committee should have made their decision in three months.
Four months have passed since our application.
Åavluk added that their application may be a breakthrough in the sporting world.

An explosive hit a house in the DaÄkapÄ± neighbourhood; two children aged 11 and 12 were killed.
Clashes occurring between security forces and the PKK left residents in a difficult situation.
Some residents left the district with a white flag hung from their cars, and those who do not have cars moved to the surrounding district taking as many articles as they could with them.
While clashes were continuing especially in the neighbourhoods that have trenches and barricades, the residents had moved to more central neighbourhoods.
However, residents had to move from there because clashes recently occurred also in these neighbourhoods.
Those who do not have a credit card are in a difficult situation.
There are many dead and wounded
126 people taken hostage were rescued during the operation which was carried out after the gun attack.
The Ministry of Security stated that three of the attackers were neutralised.
