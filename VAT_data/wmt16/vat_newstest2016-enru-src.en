The social card of residents of Ivanovo region is to be recognised as an electronic payment instrument.
Starting on September 24, the organisation of discounted travel for citizens of Ivanovo region using the social card will change.
Moreover, the social card of residents of Ivanovo region is to be recognised as an electronic payment instrument.
Accordingly, the conditions of its use will change.
The cost of discounted travel for citizens will amount to 1/2 the fare of the applicable carrier.
The schedule for topping up the social card with funds will stay the same: during the period between the 24th of the previous month through to the 23rd of the current month.
Moreover, it becomes possible to refund loaded but unspent funds.
It's also worth noting that the system of mutual settlements with carriers will become transparent, since a citizen now pays for half of the fare, and the carrier will be reimbursed in the exact same amount from the budget.
No commission fee will be charged for loading funds onto the card.
More than 470 million roubles have been set aside in the regional budget for the discounted travel of citizens using the social card.
As of September 1, the total spent for this purpose amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, "like there was something wrong with him."
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort.
This year, he was only teaching two online classes.
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes resume Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.

Michael J. Fox Jokes About His 'Date' With Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was noteworthy because of personal reasons, too.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis, and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select movie theaters Oct.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria.
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis.
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
And some are holding out for an implosion.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in enthusiasm?
On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.
The Government will decide the fate of pension indexing in October.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings equals 350 billion roubles.
The indexation of pensions in full for next year costs approximately the same amount.

North Korean authorities have reported that the country's main nuclear reactor - the nuclear complex in Yongbyon - is running "at full capacity".
A statement about this appeared on the website of the country's Central News Agency.
North Korean authorities conducted their most recent nuclear weapons test in 2013.
Moreover, since that time, no plans to resume full operation of the reactor had been reported.
Furthermore, the DPRK has never conducted a test of mid or short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
He spoke about this during a session of the State Duma, reports the Russian News Service.

Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.

Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.

Metcash launches grassroots campaign to fight Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.

Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.
But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.
Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.
However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
Agreement on the issues, and electability are also cited.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him on this.
But it's a different story among the American public overall.
The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll, conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll out Tuesday.
But Carson rocketed in that same period from 6% to 23%.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all tied for third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president to seek advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.
For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.
There are, indeed, multiple variables at play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.
That's not to say there won't be effects, however.
As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year, with all eyes turned toward this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.
Debt will become a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside pure stock plays, consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the, though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for 'dumbing down'
Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they just rip off the Brits
Colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice, saying that too wasn't original
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from our own in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.

Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down
The sad possession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers.
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque, part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects.
Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.
Others injured will receive half that amount.

Evangelos Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us".
Now, having become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is mounting a challenge to Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist from Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, judging from the polls, New Democracy has matched it in terms of popularity.
Evangelos Meimarakis: Greece has changed and we have too.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January of last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Investors have fled because Mr. Tsipras chased them away.
Evangelos Meimarakis: The fact is that Greece, as we have come to understand in recent years, cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
Right now, Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products; we have cohesion funds, and a Juncker package, and assistance in the banking sector.
But the current austerity measures are the result of how Mr. Tsipras conducted negotiations.
We were told that Tsipras' ministers never spoke about this.
That is to say, the Greek ministers were not prepared and were poorly informed, and, as a result, they conducted negotiations ineffectively and concluded a bad agreement.
We pushed forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we were operating under extraordinary circumstances.
The market crashed, and there were no prospective buyers in sight ready to pay the price the Greek government considered acceptable.
Euronews: Over the past weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been moving across Greek territory.
Evangelos Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb that we will be forced to deal with after our election victory.
We also need to effectively use the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be in a position to deal with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mister Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Druzhkovka in Donetsk region, over the course of 24 hours, members of the criminal investigation department of the Main Police Directorate for the region, in cooperation with the military intelligence service, ascertained the identity of and detained a suspect, who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian serviceman from the town of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who, on the previous evening, while consuming alcohol with the victim, and, in the process of the development of a conflict in the village of Verkhnetoretsky in the Yasinovatsky district of Donetsk, fired from an automatic weapon at his adversary.
News about the injured 22-year-old young man came from the hospital where he was admitted for gun shot wounds to his legs.
The detained man faces up to 15 years in prison.
Another two city residents were given supervised release sentences.

Yevgeny Tsyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor with Moscow's Peter Fomenko Workshop theatre.
He is known for the films "The Walk", "Space as Presentiment", "Brest Fortress", and for the television series "The Thaw" and "Fartsa".
On September 8, Yevgeny Tsyganov was recognised as "Actor of the Year" and "Person of the Year" by the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
Police in Gautier, Miss. said Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.
Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred.
It was a very bad tackle with two legs.

Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output.
The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.
Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance home and away.
The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.
I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001.
He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.

Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that.

Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.

'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.

Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.
This includes a "unique shaped-charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind-armour-effects inside the target."
Eight golden rules for living in student halls
Moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying.
It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.
Introverts get a raw deal at university.
Your room should be a retreat, yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that's friendly, social and conducive to lifelong friendships.
That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Poorly-fused lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student halls.
Double check with the milk owner.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying.
In the exhilarating moment you realise someone's left their keys inside their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems.
Some have run into problems after that installation, being hit by an error message telling them that "Software update failed."

US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow is providing to President Assad is only leading to an escalation of the conflict.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov in order to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
The publication PJ media reports on this.
They also noted that Kerry, once again, stressed the US's commitment to the fight against Islamic State within the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
Furthermore, the US "would welcome a constructive role for Russia in efforts to confront Islamic State".
Barack Obama himself believes that Russia's decision the increase support for the Assad regime is "a losing bet".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that continued support of Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't heed my warnings, and the result is that the situation has gotten worse", the US President stated.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other watercraft for leisure or sport from paying customs duties or taxes.
Yelena Lashkina, aide to the Minister of Economic Development, reported this to Izvestia.
In June 2015, as a result of a trip to Crimea, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed a number of government agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Customs Service, and the Federal Tourism Agency - to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for yachting in the costal regions of the country.
Owners prefer to store their vessels abroad: approximately €200 mln every year enters the coffers of European states for the maintenance, repair, and servicing of yachts.
According to the ministry, this would certainly support the creation of favourable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal regions of the country, Lashkina noted.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional exemption at the time of importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following approval of the meeting minutes of the sub-commission by the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will present the proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion by member states of the EEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from payment of customs duties and taxes includes goods that are necessary for facilitating foreign trade and international cooperation, for use in the fields of science, culture, film, sport, and tourism, for the provision of international aid, and others. These other goods include: office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), monitoring and measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and sets, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, race cars, motorcycles, sport aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments, and items for religious ceremonies.
The press service for the Ministry of Transportation of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they had prepared compulsory regulations for the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosiya, and Yevpatoriya, which provide for simplified procedures for registering the entry and departure of small-sized, sport sailboats, and recreational watercraft in the seaport.
The Ministry of Transportation has given orders to the captains of seaports in Crimea to ensure the administration of the simplified procedures for the entry of small-sized, sport sailboats, and recreational watercraft into the seaport and for the departure of the above-listed vessels from the seaport.
The issue is that yachting is very difficult in Russia because of poorly developed infrastructure.
In Russia, however, everything is at a virtual standstill.
Besides, within Russia, there isn't even anywhere to refuel.
In terms of places to store yachts, there are now special docks in Moscow and Saint Petersburg that can accommodate yachts up to 30m. Yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden, and Germany to be stored.
The World Bank allocates a $500 mln loan to Ukraine.
The international organisation's press service reported on this.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocs for transgender people.
A member of the council, Vladislav Grib, spoke to Izvestia about this.
The humiliation of trans people by their cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Separate pre-trial detention facilities aren't necessary, just separate cells, and blocs in prisons.
Russian human rights advocate and activist in the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender), Nikolai Alekseev, supports the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve out their sentences, noting that, abroad, it is also possible to place people in penal colonies - male or female - depending on their own preferences.
Given the climate in Russian prisons, this is the correct recommendation.
At the same time, international expert on issues of reproductive health in the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for assigning transsexual criminals to a penal colony could significantly delay the start of the convicts serving their sentences.
Mikhail Antipov wins the Junior World Chess Championship.
The world chess championship for youth under 20 has finished in Khanty-Mansiysk.
The winner was only decided in the final round, and it was Russian Mikhail Antipov who managed to finally overtake the Pole, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who looked set to claim the title.
Among the girls, victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player, Natalia Buksa.
Even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to narrow the gap to just half a point, he still remained the favourite in the fight for the title.
But even that wouldn't help if Duda won his match.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
In this way, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of a possible 13 - but Antipov had better additional criteria.

After the panicked mood at the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs declined significantly.
Financing at 25-30% per annum wasn't beneficial to anyone.
For the business community, the current level of interest rates for loans to SMEs isn't comfortable.
However, according to our observations, clients have started to apply for loans much more infrequently.
First of all, businesses can't discern the prospects for their development or future earnings.
It's necessary to more closely monitor current performance and control cash flow.
All this, ultimately, enables companies to make their production more competitive and maintain their business even in an unstable economic situation.
Which main trends in the SME lending market will become more pronounced and will influence its development up until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.

FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook

Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.

Borodai dubs the US newspaper's information as libel against Strelkov.
Former head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Aleksandr Borodai, has denied information that was published in the US newspaper, The Washington Post.
He spoke about this in a telephone interview with a correspondent from Lenta.ru.
The article in The Washington Post is wonderful in that everything is entirely misquoted.
According to Borodai, there definitely was talk about Strelkov during the conversation with the reporter from the US newspaper.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov needed to be immediately removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic", said the former head of government for the DPR.
Borodai stressed that he didn't know why the reporter from the US publication decided to write that Strelkov was "tied up" while being removed to Russian territory.
If it's not a provocation, then it's a surprising case of miscommunication, since I stressed that Strelkov left on his own", Borodai noted.
"It's libel against me and Strelkov", he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, in which Borodai was quoted as saying that he forcibly removed Strelkov to Russian territory.

Let's return dialogue and the law to the practice of international communication.

This season can be called triumphant for the 24-year-old track and field athlete from Barnaul, Sergei Shubenkov.
Novye Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the past season.
You once said that autumn is your favourite time of year.
The end of August and beginning of September is a wonderful time.
And do you get fatigued?
Every competition is stressful.
Never-ending flights and travel: it all takes a toll on the body.
Besides, you journalists won't let me forget about it either.
Did your preparations for this remarkable season differ significantly from usual?
At first, I trained at home in Barnaul, then at training camps, and then again at home.
As per usual.
I always work out my form gradually.
Like how it was at the London Olympics for example?
It was in Daegu.
How do you manage to build-up a decent speed and still not lose your head or tune-out?
Well, this is the most difficult thing.
Have you ever had those thoughts?
Home is always better.
Since I was 12 years old, when I first started track and field.
There was a children's combined event: that's when they toss a ball and long jump from that spot...
Have you ever been stricken with fear in front of the hurdles?

Thank you.
I quite enjoyed it myself.

Last year, in November, an on-site government meeting was held in Sayansk where issues concerning the socioeconomic development of the territory were discussed.
The city didn't have design and estimation documentation (DED) for even a single asset.
Right now, roadwork is already underway in two areas.
How is the RF Presidential Decree on the construction of childcare facilities being applied in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Since September 1, childcare facility No. 10 has been closed for capital repairs designed to create 320 spaces.
The estimated cost of the renovation is 86 mln roubles.
Before now, the city had never received such funds.
Last year, following renovations, childcare facility No.23 was opened and is now attended by 200 children.
The renovation was carried out via co-financing from the regional and municipal budgets and cost more than 67 mln roubles.
There are plans to start building a new childcare facility in 2016.
We don't have waitlists for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors expressing interest in the area?
In October, a 60-apartment building will be opened for orphaned children in Leningradsky microdistrict.
As far as construction is concerned, I will add that Sayansk is one of four cities in Irkutsk region that has been included in a programme to build economy-class housing.
All the required documentation has been prepared.
Construction of a 90-block section will commence soon.
As far as investors are concerned, we also have other interesting projects.
Back in the day, a pig farm was built in Sayansk that was sold, in 2004, for a pittance.
Especially since the land underneath the facility is federal property.
There is a potential investor who is ready to put 1.5 bln roubles into the redevelopment and launch of the project.
We will gain 900 jobs with the launch of the pig farm, which will be a big help to the city.
Is the institute of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded approximately 140 socio-economic partnership agreements.
The implementation of many projects was made possible thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Tangible support has been provided by enterprises such as: CJSC Vostok-Tsentr, Novo-Ziminskaya Thermal Power Plant, LLC Sayanski Broiler, and LLC PC MDF; the management of these enterprises responds to all of our requests.
Thanks to funds donated by sponsors, we managed to make improvements to the grounds of the city's civil registry office.
In nine months, more than 800 thousand roubles have been allocated to support these talented kids, to help children who require expensive treatments, and to support children from low-income families.
How are staffing issues in the social services sector dealt with in Sayansk?
The city doesn't have enough doctors or subject teachers.
Providing specialists with housing is critically important to solving the staffing issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments to doctors, and four teachers have received service housing.
We have a programme for the allocation of housing with the option to privatise it after five years.
The potential of Sayansk and of our region is great.
A bill has been introduced in the State Duma that makes provisions for the annual indexation of social pensions, in relation to rising prices, starting on February 1.
Head of the OSCE PA advises Mogherini of the impermissibility of the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Frederica Mogherini, OSCE PA Speaker, Ilkka Kanerva, advised of the impermissibility of sanctions against lawmakers involved in the activities of the Assembly.
A member of the Russian delegation to the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev, told journalists about this.
"Sufficiently strong support has already materialised", Kovalev said.
Earlier, he announced that the head of the OSCE PA expressed his intent to collect the signatures of members who pointed to the impermissibility of the introduction of sanctions in relation to parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Kanerva promised to raise this issue at the level of the governing structures of the European Union and "send a corresponding petition".

In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.
Though the new study didn't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients, Blackstone said it's reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.
Robbers steal fur coats and 9 mln roubles from a house in Mytishchi.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked inhabitants of a Moscow region house and stole 9 mln roubles and three women's fur coats from them.
Interfax reported on this with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unidentified individuals entered through the open front door of the house, which is located on Gorky Street, tied up the 20-year-old son of the homeowner, and, while threatening both of them with a knife, stole 9 mln roubles and three fur coats.
Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in Saint Petersburg have the right to house the tourists who will arrive in 2018 to watch the World Cup in football.
According to experts, this is a very worrisome sign.
There are signs that the management of thirty companies were deceiving city residents by alleging a certain number of stars in advertisements, Vladimirov noted.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all of Saint Petersburg's hotels.
Currently, tourists can depend on 30,500 rooms in the city.
"Over the past six months, hotels have not been very interested in undergoing classification", admitted the Director of the Northwestern branch of the Russian Tourism Industry Union, Ekaterina Shadskaya.
However, more recently, hotel managers have woken up and started to apply for classification, assured Shadskaya.
This is done to ensure that there isn't a 200-300% spike in prices, as happens, for example, during the Saint Petersburg Economic Forum.
"I think there will be a 50% increase", explained President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
I don't know how well it fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than rampant price increases", he noted.
"We will defend our point of view, that hostels should be maintained", says Nana Gvachiya.
However, according to her, owners of mini-hotels, should, in any case, be ready for a tightening of the Housing Code.
If a hostel is being used like a dormitory, then I agree that this is not right.
But if it is being used like a hotel, where guests stay for a short period of time, then why not?
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
"Obviously, the first to go will be housing near the stadium", noted rent specialist for the Agency for the Development and Study of Real Estate, Larisa Bragina.
Moreover, rent prices might not return to previous levels after the championship, especially in commuter communities.
This will also contribute to the construction of new traffic interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she underscored.

Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.
Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.
"A kid is not thinking this is bad for them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been very lethal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
How the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
A sad cast iron owl sits on the back of a bench by the entrance to the N. K. Krupskaya Regional Children's Library.
The kids who come for books try to feed it candies.
The first library patrons, from the twenties of the previous century, arranged loud readings, staged performances based on Mayakovsky's poems, held literary quizzes, and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The library should be named after some nice children's writer, without political overtones!
The library staff sat down together, thought about it, and decided to leave things as they were.
"Krupskaya" is probably the most well-known and best-loved library in Barnaul, just like the Lenin Library in Moscow.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favourite theme of artist Olya Moskovka.
Then she found an online advertisement: "Book illustrator needed".
"The publishing industry is growing right now, and a lot of attention is being paid to authors who are the link between generations".
If we're talking about little children, then it's important for them that there be some sort of a character that travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to say goodbye to their favourite characters.
Only children have this magical privilege.
...In the furthermost room of the library, there is a square hatch with an antique wooden staircase that leads to the basement, into the archive room.
Ellie still happily walks along the road paved with yellow bricks; lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals the magical matches; and Malchish Kibalchish still hasn't told the cursed bourgeouins the Military Secret, such is his solemn word.
These books are like passwords: you can use them to recognise your people anywhere.
Or stories by Korolenko in a well-known supplement to the magazine "Niva".
Or a bound file of "Murzilka" magazines for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, turning them a tea-like colour.
The pages of "Murzilka" have darkened with age.
Galina Vasilevna has been in-charge of the archive room her entire life.
She knows what colour Buratino's cap is, in which school year Harry Potter became captain for Gryffindor at the Quidditch championships, in which situations Carlson uses his motor silencer, and what Alisa Selezneva's father does for a living.
I read contemporary Russian authors, the latest translations...
Back then, books were the most interesting and exciting thing that had ever happened to me.
And I'm delighted when our former library patrons bring in their children, and even their grandchildren...
Rumour Mill: No Celtic disharmony
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony at Celtic as Deila admits Hoops are in a bad place but he'll turn it around.
Dons stretch lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to open up a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down disharmony talk
It has sparked rumours of disharmony at Celtic, which was dismissed out of hand by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not labouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders.
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there's no title rivalry with Rangers.
It is because Rangers aren't there.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they are interested in.
I'll turn things around, vows Deila
That is the same as we are - but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better.
To stay together now is so important.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unity.
The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The squad is doing really well.
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has dropped hints that he could retire when his contract with the Swans is up.
Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson comments
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
"It was a derby and it was heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "Safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it is playing for Celtic."
McInnes glad to "win ugly" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to cling on desperately against Hamilton Accies to see out a seventh successive league win that moved them five points clear of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.

Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.
So why do it?
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.
I cannot do that.
I like the guy.
I will just have to try to remember all the details.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.

I won't go over all the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
Man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the Canning River.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
"Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
They obviously believe I'm a cheat.
Should that make me think it's becoming personal?
Maybe people out there think I am.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.
It could have had it last night.
It had it on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into.
It is a joke.
People making these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.

He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident, failing to render assistance, and other traffic offences.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren't "too big" into wrestling.
Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting footy.
That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?
To me it's agendas.
Serbian man gets $200k bail on drug charge
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I'm proud of the Greek team, which fought until the final seconds".
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by a few mistakes.
It was a big game, AFP quotes Katsikaris as saying.
We tried to outplay them on the defence, but mistakes in the defence determined the fate of this meeting.
It's sad, but I am proud of my boys.
They fought until the final second.
CSKA newcomer, Joel Freeland, stated that he doesn't believe in the Red Army curse.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer, and, of course, after I joined the team, R-Sport quotes Freeland. Essentially, I will assume the duties of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in terms of defensive formations and offensively in the key, and I think I can handle this.
The Red Army team last won the Euroleague in 2008.
There is a perception that someone has put a hex on the team.
Of course it's difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
As far as the hex is concerned, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in curses of any kind.
I don't have any specific rituals before games; I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "The match against Roma will be special for me".
Barcelona's Head Coach, Luis Enrique, didn't try to hide that he returned to Rome for the 1st round match in the group stage of the Champions League tournament against Roma with special feelings.
According to the trainer, the face-to-face match between his previous and current teams will be far from ordinary.
To recall, Luis Enrique trained the "wolves" during the 2011-12 season, but wasn't able to put his best foot forward in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after several years, during which I had gained concrete experience, the UEFA's official website quotes Luis Enrique as saying.
I have nothing but fond memories associated with Rome.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the team in the upcoming match.
I'm expecting the type of game from Roma that they played in the Serie A against Juventus.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar has various attack options".
Ahead of the 9th round match of the Premier League with Krasnodar, Acting Head Coach for Ural, Vadim Skipchenko, mentioned the opposing team's variety of offensive tactics.
The match will take place on September 21 and starts at 16:30 Moscow time.
We'll still have to see how we will play against Krasnodar, Ural's official website quotes Skripchenko as saying.
We have a whole week of training ahead of us.
Roger Cañas: "At home, Astana can score points off of anyone at all".
In spite of the fact that the match turned out to be hard for us, I can say that we played well, the UEFA's official website quotes Cañas as saying. We lacked a bit of courage in the offense.
It's totally possible.
But first, we need to think about Galatasaray and Atletico.
At home games, we can score points off of anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll repeat this as often as necessary: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world".
Head Coach for Real, Rafael Benitez, expressed his satisfaction with a huge win in a 1st round match in the group stage of the Champions League against Shakhtar (4-0).
The expert commended forward Cristiano Ronaldo who scored three goals.
The match wasn't easy, because Shakhtar knows how to use the ball, the UEFA's official website quotes Benitez as saying.
The opponents didn't have many chances, but their counterattacks always present a risk.
I won't say that Real played ideally, but we had plenty of goal-scoring opportunities.
I am satisfied that we didn't let in any goals and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo reaffirmed his level.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo can't compare to Messi".
Barcelona defenceman, Jordi Alba, believes that no one can compare to his teammate, Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, even Real forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, can't do this.
Messi is five goals above the rest, Le Figaro quotes Abla as saying. No one can do what Messi is capable of doing.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
Everything on the pitch changes with Leo; I can't compare him with anyone else.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona not only has a unique style, but also remarkable individuals.
On the day before a match against Barcelona in the group stage of the Champions League, Roma midfielder, Daniele De Rossi, noted the importance of staying compact and having each other's back in a game against such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21:45 Moscow time.
As a reminder, Sport Express will broadcast the live match ticker.
Barcelona is a special opponent and a good team with excellent players, the UEFA's official website quotes De Rossi as saying.
In order to win against them, we will have to work hard throughout the entire match and watch out for each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he starts jockeying, so we will have to stay close together and organised.
Yezhov hopes to make it into SKA's starting line-up in the match against Slovan.
SKA goaltender, Ilya Yezhov, stressed that he hoped to make it into the Red Army team's starting line-up in the next match of the KHL Championship.
Yezhov replaced Mikko Koskinen on the ice at the 23-minute mark with a score of 0-3 and deflected every shot on his goal; SKA let in the fourth goal after the goalie was pulled for a sixth player.
The team's next match is on the road against Slovan.
I hope that in the next match I will be in the starting line-up, R-Sport quotes Yezhov as saying.
Dynamo played well and everyone has bad games.
The team still lost.
Lucie Safarova has been hospitalised with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.

Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.
Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He said he was doing it to lure them in.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date.
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his address.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) chief whip Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Nr Mugabe's address.
The chief whip said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about the threats to its politicians.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.
It is nothing major.
It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
It has never been done at Arsenal.
We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.

Di Maria scores to help PSG swat aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
It augurs well.
The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
The qualifiers are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a magnificent match from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodities prices, on Wednesday raised $2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-slashing plan.

White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
The visit, Xi's first official one to Washington, will take place on Sept. 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner that evening, after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks.
The reckless driver who hit a biker on Kutuzovsky gets 2 years in prison.
Furthermore, the court partially granted the complainants' civil claims against Deni Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
Moscow's Dorogomilovsky Court has sentenced Deni Mirzoev who hit and killed a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Prospect in Moscow.
According to Russian News Service reports, Mirzoev received a sentence of two years imprisonment in a penal colony settlement.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of the rules for traffic safety and the operation of transport vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
Furthermore, the court partially granted the complainants' civil claims in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
Mirzoev was behind the wheel of a BMW vehicle that crossed into the oncoming lane of traffic and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
The capital's police officers detained a resident of Moscow who went into one of the churches without clothes.
Moscow news agency reports on this.
According to Andrei Galiakberov, Head of the press service for the City Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Moscow, the incident took place on Tuesday, September 15, at approximately 16:00 on Kashirskoe Highway.
A naked man entered the Church of St. Nicholas.
He behaved calmly and didn't commit any illegal acts.
He turned out to be a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
Vladimir Yakushev signs more than 40 decisions and orders.
The Governor of Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, has signed more than 40 decisions and orders at a session of the presidium of the regional government.
A portion of them concerned the allocation of funds to educational and medical institutions in the municipal districts of the region.
In particular, funds were dispensed for the purchase of a bus for a school in Nizhnetavdinsky district, and for capital repairs to the regional hospital in Kazansky district.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what objectives does the Sochi forum set?
It is built on the effective cooperation of the regions, and important links between the two states.
The Governor of Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I'll add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk in June of last year.
More that two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, took part in the event.
At that time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The significance of the work we have accomplished is evidenced by the fact that a meeting of the standing seminar of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
Issues associated with the work of the Tyumen trading house, Belshina, and options for loss prevention, were discussed.
These are important issues, since investment projects need to work well and generate profit for the region.
The continued delivery of JSC MAZ passenger trucks and development of the JSC MAZ service centre, which was established in Tyumen at the JSC TPATP facility, were also talked about.
These issues also concerned the regional centre.
During the meeting with the Head of the Administration of Tyumen city, Aleksandr Moor, we talked about upgrading the Tyumen bus fleet.
Approximately 100 buses are already "at death's door", and, as such, a new set of vehicles from Belarus is needed, which will operate on clean gas fuel.
Yet another aspect: the Tyumen elevator factory is working with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products, JSC Mogilevliftmash, by procuring components from them.
In my opinion, these activities could become even more developed, given the programme to install new elevators in the regional centre.

Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.
It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Kadyrov's original complaint regarding the book, "A Prayer to God", has been received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Court.
The original appeal by the Presidential Representative for Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognise the book, "A Prayer to God: It's meaning and place in Islam", as "extremist material", has been received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court, Interfax reports, with reference to the chairperson of the city court, Aleksandr Chukhrai.
The court is now waiting for possible objections from parties to the proceedings.
Chukhrai declined to comment on statements by several deputies from the Russian State Duma about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies and ISIS.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision by Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognise the book as "extremist material".
An appeal from the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Prosecutor's Office was received Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to only recognise the opinion of the author of the book as extremist and not the verses from the Koran.
It is the opinion of the prosecutor's office that the judge made the wrong ruling", Chukhrai stated.
The decision to recognise the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.
Kadyrov has called those who made the ruling about the book "devils and provocateurs".
He has requested State Duma deputies to legislatively ban the court's decision concerning the texts from the holy book.
According to Heiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notices explaining the reason for the deletion of their entries.

Lost mushroom picker is found in Elninsky woods after five days.
Without food or water.
Relatives, rescue workers, and volunteers were searching for him.
The man was only found after a helicopter joined the search efforts.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich went out into the woods, as per usual, to collect honey fungus and birch boletus mushrooms, but he hadn't returned by the evening.
Relatives immediately called for help and, already on the next day, rescue workers and concerned residents from the neighbouring village started searching: there were approximately 30 people in total.
On the fifth day, a helicopter from the fire-rescue centre joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group section of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said: "The helicopter was brought in and the man was found".
It was around 12 km from the search area.
The mushroom picker was admitted to Elninsky Central District Hospital unconscious and in critical condition.
Paramedics diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as with severe dehydration and hypothermia.
The pensioner, Vitaly Aleksandrovich, comes to Smolenshchina from Tambov region every year.
Aleksei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared the following: "The woods aren't far from the road; he's not really a local himself."
Obviously, he went a little too far and got lost.
Furthermore, it's advisable to leave a trail behind you, so that later on it's possible to find your way back.

Vesti Economy - Nobel Laureate: Globalisation
Eric Maksin.
Proponents of globalisation predicted great benefits for developing economies.
However, not everything is so rosy.
Specific processes are at play in the new global market.
Kremer and E. Maksin have proposed a remarkably beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
The solution to the problem, in Eric Maksin's opinion, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, the academic notes, don't have the money for this, and it's not profitable for companies to pay for their training.

Derbent is one of the most ancient cities in Russia; in September, it celebrates its 2000th anniversary.

The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the US Embassy's American Centre at the M.I. Rudomino All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation as of late call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the relationship between the Russian and American peoples, which was maintained even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries", reads a statement by US Ambassador John Tefft received by Interfax.

Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a judicial authority established in 2010, in order to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that has accompanied the explosive economic growth of the past decades.
Despite the government's formal support of the green movement, the NGT is regularly criticised by Narendra Modi's government, since it is frequently the main cause for the cancellation of large investment projects.
For example, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the courts rulings "extreme" and "unenforceable".
Sometimes the court's decisions really are impossible to carry out within the judicially set timeframe, confirms Raj Panjwani, an environmental lawyer.
"People will lose their jobs", Kumar commented on his ruling.
