There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, "like there was something wrong with him."
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He was quite the heartthrob back then.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Later, they played together in the occasional gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
There was no sign of anything amiss.
Schmidt, the slain professor, directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
While the holidays themselves are months away, holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was noteworthy because of personal reasons, too.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis, and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select movie theaters Oct.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis.
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).
The next closest in enthusiasm?
On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time last cycle, four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination, vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.
Czech Republic to gain more than 400 million crowns
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this will mean that both the state treasury and municipalities will receive more money.
In the year before last, municipalities gained approx. 450 million crowns and the state treasury 150 million crowns.
The amendment also anticipates the increase in payments from extraction areas with mining permits to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Minister for Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that, thanks to this, municipalities will receive 100 million crowns per year, as opposed to the previous figure of 14 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but stipulated by the government through decrees.
Minister Mládek responded saying that this would not be a tax, as in this case the government is making minerals - which are state property - subject to a fee.
Fees are received by the municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 a Starostové) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, as they would have to pay higher fees directly into state coffers.
"You can't asset-strip some of the poorest regions just so that the Finance Minister can improve his budget," said David Kádner (Úsvit), whose constituency is in the Ústí nad Labem Region
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed the rejection of the amendment, and Kučera wanted to return it to the government for revision.
The chief consumers, power stations, would not, therefore, feel an increase in prices.
According to Milan Urban (ČSSD), who tabled the amendment, a key issue is for MPs to know the conclusions reached regarding the updated energy concept and, chiefly, the government's decision on coal extraction limits before passing the law.
We must take that into account.
and according to how it's going, said Navrátil at the Czech team's training session today at the Raja Kumar Khanna Centre.
Team number one and world number forty Jiří Veselý is expected to take part in both the Friday and Sunday singles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek will probably take it in turns as the team number two.
I have an idea in my head, but I won't talk about it now, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Štěpánek's participation in the Saturday doubles.
The remaining options are with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
He said that he would decide according to how the singles develop.
One option could be Pavlásek, who provided for a surprise win in the 1st round against the Australians.
"He's decent in doubles," said Navrátil.
It worked for me against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to give the same performance that I did there from the second set onwards.
"I'm glad for the experience and I'd like to score a point," said Pavlásek.
The number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
"What decides are momentary form and the weather," said Navrátil.
However, it will be possible to play under floodlights.
"It should be possible to play it to a finish under lights," said Navrátil.
Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed.

The pound jumped following data showing a pick-up in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by bid target SABMiller.
The rate was the fastest since 2009, and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the stand-out stock on the market, jumping 20% after it received a bid approach from rival AB InBev.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm, he says.
Controversial building halted.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the ruling to be unlawful and will appeal.
Part of the building was to be built on land belonging to the National Gallery, whose permission the investor had not, however, obtained.
It follows from official material submitted that the owner of the land only gave its consent to the project material for the planning process, and not to the location of the building on its land, wrote the construction office.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetto from the investment company, the construction office did not take into account a ruling by its superior body, the Ministry for Regional Development, according to which the deadline for the start of a survey had already expired.
It was, in any case, a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we observe all laws of the Czech Republic and respect all authorities and institutions concerned," said Razetto in a press release.
The project, nicknamed the marshmallow due to the facade colour allegedly proposed, has provoked strong emotions in Prague.
Associations and inhabitants of nearby houses objected to the fact that some permits had been issued years ago for a building that looked different.
They also criticised the unsuitability of the building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the Convent of St. Agnes.
The building was designed by Zdeněk Fránek, who changed the project several times.
However, the NHI and the heritage department at the municipal authority approved a new project by Praga Progetti e Investimenti featuring windows in the shape of faces, and it was on this basis that planning permission was issued.
Czech politician gives migrants a lift
At the time it wasn't yet a criminal offence, he claimed to Lidové noviny.
The politician eventually spent nine hours in a cell.
He says that the police behaved properly, but there were communication problems because their English wasn't very good.
However, he says that the prison was miserable.
For example, 15 Syrian refugees were crammed in a cell measuring about three by four metres.
They had already been in the cell for a day and due to the language barrier didn't know what was going to happen to them, said Berg.
Ask the president of the Chamber of Executors of the Czech Republic.

Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering taste testing at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were most loyal.
But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.
"One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi's been dragged into the fray a little bit," Healy said.
He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.
We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary contests, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.
However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the top pick.
Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll, leaving others scrounging for a foothold
The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.
Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.
Members of New York City's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
"At this point, members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity's well-being over that of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.
Here's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year, with all eyes turned toward this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
Fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.
Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yield," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for 'dumbing down'
Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name.
BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22million.
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a particularly BBC way."
Internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £1 in every £5 was being spent online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.
Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca
The sad possession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not report that detail, but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad.
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials ordered one million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.
B&Q boss says Eastern European tradesmen working cheap is behind trend
Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury
Resulting in 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at tradesmen, opening
At same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country
If you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls, it seems you are in the minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Currently the majority of staff are men.
Mrs Laury said: "We still have a majority of men working in our stores.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain's FTSE100 index of leading firms, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women, including its chief executive and finance director.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
Kingfisher posted a fall in both half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores.
As a result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores
December allowance of 600 crowns to pensioners under threat
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said TOP 09 deputy chairman Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasised the principle of deservedness.
ODS parliamentary party leader Zbyněk Stanjura noted that, while the one-off payment sounded good, in the long-term it would be better if it were part of the standard adjustment, as it would then be felt in years ahead.
Marksová defended the additional amount, arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she says is not a good one.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right-wing parties that in the past they had lowered the adjustment rate.
Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) highlighted the fact that the proposal does not discuss the reduction of actual pensions in 2016 and later.
However, the committee will have one month, rather than the usual two, for the discussion.
The bonus should cost the state a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
Next year pensions should rise by an average of approximately one hundred crowns.
They would have to apply for the payment in writing, no later than by the end of next year.
Yakunin abandons plans for a political career, will devote himself to science.
One complication for Yakunin was the fact that he has not lived in the Kaliningrad Oblast for twenty years, as required by law.
The Kremlin had, though, granted Yakunin an exemption on the grounds that he was an extraordinary and authorised plenipotentiary to whom the legal requirement for long-term residency did not apply.
Shooting of the Czech comedy Teorie tygra (Theory of the Tiger) has concluded
The final straw for the resolution of the main character is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has lost strength and patience.
The grandmother (Iva Janžurová) made the decisions on the grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
Jan can see that he is going the same way with his wife Olga (Eliška Balzerová).
He remembers that once he had his own will and dreams, and wants to live a free, dignified life.
Bajgar wanted to use the comedy form to capture a certain type of relationship, in which one of the partners doesn't live a totally free life.
Despite this, he says that the actor, who was appearing in front of the cameras after a long break caused due to convalescence from a serious illness, surprised him.
We agreed on this three years ago.
And he surprised me by saying that he was a closet athlete.
According to Bartoška, women marry tigers so that over time they can make rabbits out of them.
That's what we're trying to convey in our film, says the actor.
His wife, who may come across to audiences as a slightly negative character, is played by Eliška Balzerová.
She isn't only a negative character.
At the same time she's a usurper and wants to cook him to death, adds Bajgar.
The film tells the parallel story of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka (Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová) and sons-in-law Erik and Pepík (Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák).
The film is produced by Petr Erben from Logline Production and co-produced by Czech Television and Radio and Slovak Television.
The announcement was made on Tuesday by Google.org, the charity offshoot of the Internet company.
The European Parliament resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
We do not have any such plans at this point in time.
However, nothing is ruled out, he stated.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad as a lost bet.
This may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a more long-term goal, the nature of which was not, according to Earnest, clear.
On the other hand, the Russian leader apparently does not intend to mention the situation in the Donbass, Ukraine at all.
means that these oils are also suitable as a component of healthy diet, including for gall bladders.
which, according to the Czech Institute of Health Information and Statistics, is the long-term most common cause of death in the Czech Republic.
Inflammation of the gall bladder mainly affects women, but sesame oil helps.
It often occurs in gall-bladder diets.
Gall-bladder issues generally affect people who are overweight, don't take part in sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Higher temperatures would entail a loss of nutritious substances.
A study conducted by Jarmila Hamerská (Masarykova univerzita, Brno) found that 43% of respondents preferred sunflower oil when cooking.
It's better for e.g. seasoning salads and as part of controlled diet, where it helps prevent cardiovascular disease,
If you have heart problems, take care about the amount of fat and calories you consume.
Hemp oil has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
Users often consume one teaspoonful on an empty stomach in the morning.
A wide variety of grilling competitions take place all over the world, only confirming the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs have nothing to be ashamed of here either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, only 4% of people have never grilled.
Which oil is the most suitable for this, while retaining healthy substances during grilling?
When you say 'meat', the experts from Bohemia Olej from Kraslice near Sokolov think of grape oil.
Seasoning gives the meat taste and oil conserves it and gives it the right bite, advises Daniel Vlček.
The same applies to grilling.
Sprinkle the grate with oil before grilling to prevent the burning of food.
Add a few drops of grape oil to finish.
Multiple sclerosis: it's not just about the medication, but also about the patient's will to fight.
For example, it has been proved that regular movement significantly delays the time when the patient requires a compensatory aid, for example a walking-stick.
The earlier we intervene, the greater the hope that we can stop the disease and postpone invalidisation, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Physiotherapy, which most often deals with the weakening of the lower limbs and balance disorders, is also highly important for those with multiple sclerosis.
"It really is individual and depends on the specific difficulties being suffered by the patient," says MUDr. Martina Kövári, senior consultant at the Physiotherapy and Physical Medicine Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
Movement also strengthens the immune system, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
A further positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that patients can check what all they can do, strengthening their self-confidence.
"Exercise also releases endorphins, which help you feel good," notes PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Physiotherapy Clinic of the Královské Vinohrady Faculty Hospital.
It also has a direct effect on the patient's mental state and immune processes, stabilising the disease, she adds.
The goal of physiotherapy is for the patient to stay self-sufficient for as long as possible, including at work.
Physiotherapists therefore cooperate with ergotherapists to ensure that every patient receives made-to-measure compensatory aids.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
They must respond to a considerable burden - the loss of their health.
Aviation manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
"We haven't found any better solution," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of aviation doors manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
Previously known as Letov, the company produces complete door systems for the Airbus A320 at its complex in the Letňany district of Prague.
It is the only company in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170 model.
However, advanced technology has not yet entirely replaced human senses.
These must be attached manually but riveters.
It takes them two days.
The tolerance limits within which they operate are minimal.
When an inspector runs their finger along a row of rivets, they recognise when one is outside the tolerance limit.
It won a tender for the supply of emergency doors for the A321 model.
Approaches to Boeing were not so successful.
The next day we started negotiations with the French, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company, and with a major company came new orders.
Three years later, they also started producing doors for the upper deck of the A380.
In 2006 the company built a new production hall for the processing of composites for orders for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere we wouldn't have won those big orders ourselves.
Maybe we'd have been making parts or small components.
Our partners want a twenty- to thirty-year guarantee for goods supplied, explains Dubský.
Last year the Czech Latecoere achieved turnover of over 2.9 billion crowns and an after-tax profit of 147 million crowns.
Having an exclusive status among suppliers to aviation manufacturers comes at a price.
Since 2000, Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in the Prague company.
According to Dubský, gaining certification that production processes meet clients' requirements and maintain them through repeated inspections costs millions of crowns.
We have to give employees additional training, upgrade equipment and have the entire process re-certified, adds Dubský.
Then we produce their goods.
However, this does not mean that they can name their price for doors.
An integral part of the contract is the price curve.
The piece price falls to a certain limit value.
If not, we'll be losing money, says Dubský.
It is, however, a symbol of the future.
"This is a growing trend in aviation riveting," adds Dubský.
Airbus has announced that airlines have so far ordered 3,270 of the the A320 model.
Only a few metres away they are building a production line for the complete assembly of doors for the upper deck of the A380.
This was a strategic decision of our parent company.
The goal is to shorten the production time and lower costs.
The full assembly process could start within two years, says Dubský.
"It's a massive boost to the company when it can produce both metal and composite materials," says Dubský proudly.
However, Latecoere is reaching the limit of its production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no more space in the Letov complex where it is based.
In the end, Latecoere was able to come to an agreement with its main creditors,
who exchanged part of their loans for shares at the end of August.
The Czech plant in Letňany is a major one for the group,
In the year before last, municipalities gained approx. 450 million crowns and the state treasury 150 million crowns.
The amendment also anticipates the increase in payments from extraction areas with mining permits to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Minister for Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that, thanks to this, municipalities will receive 100 million crowns per year, as opposed to the previous figure of 14 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but stipulated by the government through decrees.
Minister Mládek responded saying that this would not be a tax, as in this case the government is making minerals - which are state property - subject to a fee.
Fees are received by the municipalities whose territory is affected by mining.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 a Starostové) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, as they would have to pay higher fees directly into state coffers.
"You can't asset-strip some of the poorest regions just so that the Finance Minister can improve his budget," said David Kádner (Úsvit), whose constituency is in the Ústí nad Labem Region
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed the rejection of the amendment, and Kučera wanted to return it to the government for revision.
The chief consumers, power stations, would not, therefore, feel an increase in prices.
According to Milan Urban (ČSSD), who tabled the amendment, a key issue is for MPs to know the conclusions reached regarding the updated energy concept and, chiefly, the government's decision on coal extraction limits before passing the law.
However the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move.

Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.
Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked an online job from her home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.

Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
He was crying.
I hope he can play again this season.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you everyone for your messages, words can't describe how gutted I am, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."
The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
If any player goes off with this kind of injury, everybody is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Smalling.

Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me.
I wouldn't rule out an away win, either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.
There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.
A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.
The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me; he is a team man above all else.
The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.
The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.
Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference.
People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.
Colly's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this.
While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes, even without the election of genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Labour leadership, or the TUC cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
It's all about me.
"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation."
The Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2:1.
The press never forgave him that either.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.
He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.
As with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC won't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home.
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.
The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals" biggest rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, admittedly made in-house.
Frankly other channels would give their right arm for it.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.

The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof, produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

One of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."

Eight golden rules for living in student halls

Apple hit by the yo-yo effect.
Up until now the trend with Apple has been for every generation of iPhone to be lighter than the one before it.
The only exceptions to this were the third and fourth generations, whose weight was slightly more than that of preceding iPhones.
This is far from true for new iPhones.
This meant that displays had to be fitted with an extra layer of capacity sensors.
In the iPhone 6s the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s is thus 192 grammes.
Have flakes been the breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
Archaeologists in Grotta Paglicci, Italy have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
However, at level 23A, which according to the tools found dates back 30 thousand years, researchers have found something that is strongly reminiscent of the remains of a breakfast buffet.
At the site they found traces of oat grains that apparently went through a production process similar to the oat flakes that are so popular today.
While researchers were not able to prove in their article for PNAS magazine that the complete flake production process took place in the cave, the resemblance is quite striking.
At the same time it is highly interesting evidence of how intensively people used cereals, even long before the rise of agriculture.
Thus if the oat flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes preceded agriculture by approximately twenty thousand years.
So once again I listened to the announcements of the names of stops in the trolleybus: Hnusáčkova, Přízrak, Frázova, Spratecká.
Then I wouldn't have to listen to stops called Vodní Heršpice, Šmírova, or Ponorná in the screeching tram that I got onto at Komárov.
Before that day I understood the announcements quite well.
Good morning, comrade superintendent
I entered the dispatcher's office at the moment the radio announced that it was seven o'clock.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
What's it all about?
I pulled a file with periodic announcements out of a drawer. At that moment the phone rang.
The superintendent was sitting behind his desk, looking over some paperwork.
I became disconcerted.
Only yesterday his deputy was praising me, saying that I'd settled in very well in my few months in the job and that he was happy with me to the highest possible degree,
and that the superintendent had done very well when he pulled me out of the track brigade.
To you, I'm not Mr Superintendent, but Comrade Superintendent.
Now kindly remember that!
You'll hear more about that later.
When the superintendent told someone that something wasn't one of their virtues, the prospects weren't good for whoever was on the receiving end.
Jovial, puffed-up, authoritarian, arrogant, whatever suited him at any given moment.
So be it, he's the superintendent.
How would I support two children?
And the half-built house!
I was ready to cry, but I controlled myself.
I wouldn't give him that pleasure.
It was quite the meeting in the superintendent's office.
And the most important person, the chairman of the Party organisation.
I knew him from the railway line.
And when they closed the jail he ended up with a pickaxe working on the railway line.
So far so good, I thought and breathed just a little bit better.
I had been a member of the town committee of the Union of Socialist Youth, where I was chosen as a Party candidate.
Once the vetting officer had finished reading, only the tapping of the superintendent's pencil on the table interrupted the tense silence.
During this I had constantly been silently repeating to myself "Communists - superpeople, Communists - superpeople". What had I got myself into?
Why hadn't I stayed with the blacksmiths?
I could have fixed points without any bloody checks.
Well, according to the assessment from his previous employment.
Do you have it here?
"Well," declared the superintendent with a hint of joviality, which was, however, often the harbinger of a storm.
Except the important stuff was missing.
The comrade gave it to me when he joined us.
Is that sufficient?
"So when you were put in a technical job this slip of paper was enough," said the superintendent drily.
He'd managed it for the time being.
My vision went dark and I started feeling hot.
It was all one to me now.
I didn't care that I'd be thrown out of my position as a mechanical officer.
I didn't care that they'd take my pickaxe away from me.
"That will be enough, comrade superintendent," said the Party chairman suddenly, emphatically interrupting the superintendent's lecture.
Don't forget that, comrade superintendent!
That's why we must give that young comrade a chance!
A chance to show that he has changed.
And who else should give him that than you, comrade superintendent?
It is your responsibility to support this young, yes, somewhat confused comrade in his efforts to reform!
In fact, it the responsibility of us all as Party members.
Here the comrade must see that the Party has not forgotten us.
Once the chairman had finished, no-one said a word.
No-one had expected such a turnaround in the situation.
Least of all me.
"I agree with you entirely, comrade chairman," said the superintendent icily, nodding in agreement, trying to take back the initiative.
If you had let me finish, then you would have heard that I was getting to exactly this conclusion.
Everyone nodded their heads in agreement, but you could see that they didn't believe a single word.
And our vetting officer?
"He'll catch it from the old man," she noted maliciously.
He definitely won't enjoy it today.
Be careful around him though, he's quite vengeful.
The water for the coffee was starting to boil and the office soon filled with the scent of freshly poured coffee.
Perhaps I was out of the woods.
They wouldn't fire me now, and the next checks wouldn't be for three years.

Village symbol comes to life
After years of inactivity, the wheel of the Chlum windmill is again turning.
People from the surrounding area call it the 'Chlum fan'.
The Chlum windmill is a local technological monument.
a seven-metre well was dug in the village, which lies near the turn-off to Číchov.
"The structure was built by the firm of Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě at a cost of 2,400 crowns," states the plaque on the enclosure of the mast structure.
7 May 1973 saw the opening of a new chapter in the fight for water: on this day a new pipeline started serving Chlum.
It was only in 2008 that the local inhabitants decided to repair the windwheel and put it back into operation
On the occasion of the homecoming gathering the village had the replica wheel modified and re-mounted on top of an iron tower.
However, the wheel only pumps water from the well to a blind spillway.
It pumped empty.
No hard feelings, but I've never heard of Lafata, admits Tripolis mainstay Goian.
Just that this time we won't lose," continued Goian.
I know that he's a very good striker, that's also why he went to Sparta, said Goian.
He had a helpless look on his face, as if to say: "Why are you asking me about that?"
After a moment of silence he spoke.
We've seen a few videos and we've seen that Sparta plays very much as a team.
It has some really good players.
And Lafata?
"He has experience with bigger clubs, you could say that he keeps Asteras's defence going, he organises their play," noted Sparta assistant coach Stanislav Hejkal.
We're expecting an unusual, aggressive style, says the coach.
For me they are the favourites in this game, but we are playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
We will try to win, just like Sparta, said Goian.

Kofola to move from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague stock exchange.
New headquarters would be in Ostrava.
The steps that we have so far taken in this project are primarily of a legal and administrative nature and do not have a real impact on events within the company, says Daniel Buryš, CFO of the Kofola group.
The moving of the headquarters of the holding company and the related share transfers will take the form of a non-public transaction in which only existing shareholders will participate.
"Any offering of shares to new investors would take place - if so decided by the company and its shareholders - at a later stage, either in the fourth quarter of 2015 or the first quarter of 2016," stated the company.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and in Poland, including the placing of shares on the Warsaw stock exchange.

Silverfish moved into my formica toilet.
First by hand and then with chemicals.
I think it was called Zyklon B.
Or something else?
But I digress.
At our new home my partner and I agreed that, just so long as they weren't climbing around our necks, they were free to tuck into fallen flakes of skin, invisible eyelashes and so on.
After a while their peaceful existence was disrupted by a spider.
It was a normal type of corner-dweller that that settled in on the ceiling.
It took about three days, during which they didn't move and didn't react to our checks.
Below the toilet bowl, where the romantic games took place, we later found the dried-out remains of the male next to the female.
After that the spider didn't move for weeks on end.
When we thought it was all over, we were surprised by a large number of small spiders dangling in various places around her.
They soon disappeared.
We don't know whether she went somewhere else or died, but after a month she re-appeared on the ceiling.
The large number of somewhat more numerous silverfish was again reduced and the spider quietly went about its business of feeding itself.
We were ever-more insistent in getting her to use the toilet.
There was nothing else to do.
It was up to me.
I parted from it as I would a friend, but after such a long time together I felt horrible, as if I was kicking out a relative.
I started to speculate about the cause.
But then the first medium-sized ones appeared and soon it was swarming with them.
Or maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection to their predator and its rapid disappearance provoked some panic response in them.
I'm am under no illusions about their powers of vision.

Hospitals in the Zlín Region to expect changes worth 1.5 billion.
"It's a success when you consider that all four have been in the black for all of this year," stated regional governer Stanislav Mišák contentedly.
The total profit of regional facilities is currently about 32 million crowns.
This is partly due to higher payments from insurance companies, and which are just as favourable for this year.
{Preparations are therefore being made in Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Uherské Hradiště for construction work that will cost a total of 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we only bought instruments has ended.
Now we must start to construct new buildings, as top healthcare is not possible without them, said regional deputy minister for healthcare Lubomír Nečas.
A tendering process is now underway in Vsetín for a supplier for a new pavilion for internal medicine worth nearly 300 million crowns.
The addition of a dialysis unit is planned in Kroměříž.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new ward worth 200 million crowns to the central pavilion that it opened this year.
Greater comfort for patients.
"For example, our internal medicine department was built thirty-five years ago and now it's reaching the end of its lifespan," pointed out Pavel Calábek, director of Zlín Hospital.
Within a few years it will be replaced by a modern, seven-storey building connected to the accident and emergency department,
Construction work following the same model in Uherské Hradiště is already half-finished.
"Construction work will be paid through a loan and partly from our own funds," explained hospital director Petr Sládek.
Patients of the hospital in Kroměříž can also look forward to changes.
Repairs to the sobering-up station will be complete this year, after which work will begin on a dialysis unit and a building to house a new magnetic resonance unit.

Nobody has explained to how I am supposed to keep refugees in the Czech Republic when they don't want to live here.
Following a meeting with his European counterparts Minister for the Interior Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that other countries are putting pressure on the Czech Republic to accept refugee distribution quotas while rejecting any discussion.
He also adds that nobody has yet explained how he is to keep allocated refugees in the Czech Republic when they don't want to live there anyway.
Could you describe more specifically the position that you took into the meeting of EU foreign and interior ministers?
We cannot talk about migrants as if they were bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have a vision, are going somewhere, have relatives.
What we wanted to hear from our colleagues was how they would keep migrants on the territory of Member States if they were redistributed.
We cannot imagine this.
We didn't get an answer, so we requested that quotas be left out of the final text.
We have been speaking about this for a year and think that this is the way forward.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
Not long ago we were discussing forty thousand, now it's one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how will we keep those people in our country?
Almost no-one wants to come here, we simply don't know how to keep them here.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more this way?
They will come to our detention facilities and we will treat them the same as the ones we have caught.
because Europe's attitude is that if they're registered, they can't be held.
If we're able to hold them for the duration of their asylum proceedings, we will start those proceedings.
Then they get documents that allow them to travel in Europe.
Then there are the four hundred people who'll be resettled here.
To show them unambiguously that they don't have a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany last year alone.
Now it's eighty, and on the first day it was twelve.
We still have several hundred free spaces in brick-and-mortar detention facilities.
Where is the tipping point?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
He takes a considerable interest in the whole issue, and we talk on the ophone several times per day.
I don't think it'll go that far here.
This would only marginally concern the Czech Republic - hardly at all.
The Slavia football team has paid off its debts.
Footballers have received their money too.
It should be said that she did have a case.
One of the main arguments was that, the week before last, Slavia was taken over by CEFC China, a large industrial and investment group from China, and Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
"Everything was paid between 11 and 15 September," stated Slavia's legal representative, Zuzana Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay the money to?
Both current and former players and commercial partners.
The club also paid fees due to the Prague 10 Municipal Authority on Friday.
Nonetheless, we are prepared to pay these amounts, should we lose these cases.
Mládková told the judge that "We have the requisite funds on a bank account, which we can demonstrate through the submission of an account statement."
"Everything that was due has been paid," declared Mládková, adding that the only unpaid liabilities were that were not yet due, or disputed.
It is also certain that the judge will not come to a decision within the next few days and that the proceedings shall continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that it really has paid the aforementioned debts.
All evidence will then be assessed.
A decision will be made by November at the earliest.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but in writing following it.
You'll waste less time and material fixing faulty welds.
We highly value these honours as they confirm the exceptionality of our product.
We have already made our first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly expand after the trade-fair in Brno.
Blanka could have been built so as to not collapse,
during a press tour of the tunnel on Wednesday evening.
It's always a compromise between cost and safety.
"If that method had been used 500 metres earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion crowns more expensive," stated Butovič.
According to Metrostav director Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is overpriced, he told Euro magazine.
According to the original plans the tunnel should have cost 17 billion crowns.
Once technology, land purchases, engineering activities, adjustments and similar items are included, the cost is 29 billion, which isn't that far off 37 billion, said Bělohlav.
If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't let the update go ahead, since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking.
FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from an earlier prediction.
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.
Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week.
Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.
"Absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks, they would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Frequently referred to as the Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
The store is massive, and it will take over an hour to comb through all the aisles.
If all that shopping makes you hungry, grab a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
What it stocks: Need something - anything - Thai?
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet fish, and even fry it for you if you'd like.
Who shops there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts.
Where is it: The store is in an industrial part of Los Angeles hugging the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
The amendment to the Roads Act will now be passed on to the president.
MPs have now assented to this proposal.
The amendment is also intended to help improve the protection of roads and make it easier for municipalities to handle vehicles that have been towed away and that are not claimed by the owners.
Ústí mayor to go on trial
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced Little Citizens' Welcome project.
According to the legal classification of the case, both may receive prison sentences of up to ten years.
The indictment states that, according to the state prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused damage to the minimum amount of one million crowns.
It continues to state that, at the same time, they were aware Darothore, following its awarding of this contract, charged Ústí nad Labem a price for the realisation of the Little Citizens' Welcome event that was disproportionately excessive compared to the true value of services actually provided.
According to records, the company received more than five million crowns over three years.
According to the expert report, the amount paid was excessive by at least one million crowns.
Mandík had previously denied any breach of the law.
I didn't commit any criminal offence, I'm innocent.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same amount of money," added Mandík.
Criminal investigators originally also wanted to charge MP Kailová, who had also been a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not release her for prosecution.
Criminal investigators therefore adjourned the case regarding her, but anticipate charging Kailová once her mandate in the Chamber of Deputies ends.
Hungarian police allegedly set a dog on a refugee,
then forced journalists to delete footage.
However, this accusation is questioned by the Hungarian government.
The fact that Muzi was filming this was noticed by one police officer, who stopped him from leaving.
They then ordered him to delete the recording.
Muzi thus lost the results of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
AP sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
He said that the police had only wanted him to show them whether they were in some pictures, to which they allegedly had a right.
When they found that they weren't, they didn't force him to delete anything.
The unpredictable Champions League
Win at City will give us a boost, believe Juventus
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created many chances, but we had the ball for longer.
In Manchester they were replaced by Pogba, Mandžukić and Morata.
Because when we're on one, we're among the best teams in Europe.
"Before our equaliser we could have conceded for 2:0, but Gianluigi kept us in there," Allegri was full of praise for goalkeeper Buffon.
"We wasted several good chances," said City midfielder Yaya Touré.
So let's pause for a moment.
Well, it isn't just desperate children coming here; take a look at the boats landing at the Greek islands and you won't see too many children!
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian church set up by the Eritreans didn't make such a big impression on Europeans.
This summer we were lying on the private beach of a hotel in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus.
If you weren't lying on one and were in the sea, bad luck.
Then they took over the local beach bar and started partying.
Mothers and children ran away from the dining patio to somewhere quiet.
Not in English of course.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight from the bottle.
Everyone had disappeared.
The hotel employees were scared to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice: "Did you see the gold they had on them?"
"Are they drug smugglers?" I asked.
They smuggle something else entirely.
Then it was clear to me what they were smuggling.
I had no idea what was to follow.
But the secret services and leading politicians should be the first to know.
I don't think they wouldn't know.
And they come and come and come.
Germany and its politicians - nowadays publically recognised as the main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - and not just them, as well as EU heads of state and television, including ours.
Of course there were a few trendy liberals at the station, but mainly it was - established German - Muslims that were welcoming them.
However, anyone who has spent just a few days in Germany knows that this is a massive lie.
This is confirmed by further information,
for example the famous public opinion survey conducted by ARD, the Consortium of Public Broadcasters in Germany.
She further said: "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts for such coexistence have failed totally."
It has failed completely.
It appears, particularly in light of recent statement by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
What has happened to the Germans?
Those who for years tried, at least outwardly? to come to terms with their terrible past as aggressors and murderers of millions?
When he said that the Greater German idea would destroy Germany?
Once he was deposed, preparations started for the First World War.
Following Marxist attempts to take over the country, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology, based for example on ecology, which was, for example, one of the chief ideological branches of Nazism, started to develop.
or woe betide you!
When we add to this the fact that immigrants are a highly suggestible group of voters, we have what we have.
who, attracted by the siren calling, will soon run up against the wall of reality that Merkel does want to see, and will start to rebel.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim shelters are already burning.
The best way to get rid of pushy salesmen: scare them to death.
Maybe it's a shame that you can't get a talking doorknocker in real life.
Here it'd be good for scaring off all sorts of tricksters and bastards.

Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to cover the leadership spill on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's dash to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership spill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for Today.
That tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today's 339,000.
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning folks!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to relocate to seaside New Zealand with his two children, averaged a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Seven's The X Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed fortunes on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (5pm to 5.30pm) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5.30pm to 6pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings drop will have Nine quietly confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5.30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to dent McGuire's show.

Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy.
And the three girls left standing certainly aren't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as, apart from themselves, the best match for Wood.
"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday, 7.30pm on Ten.
Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.
But Tomsula showed faith in his man, giving Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it to his Instagram.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by someone else.
As it wasn't possible to return their property after 1989, the couple turned to the state with a request for compensation according to the law on out-of-court rehabilitation.
Evita now played by Radka Fišarová in Studio DVA musical
She was recommended for the role of the first lady of Argentina by Monika Absolonová.
I suddenly saw a new approach here.
By and large I am a fan of modern adaptations, but this one is particularly successful.
"Ondřej Sokol's direction is original, relaxed and contemporary," says Fišarová.
The handing over of the baton between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolonová's Birthday Concert, which takes place from 7 p.m. on 27 September at the Studio DVA theatre.
The evening will culminate with excerpts from the musical Evita.
Due to public interest, further performances up to May 2016 have been scheduled.

Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death toll.

It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents.
"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.
Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.
A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
So you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey sitting around, but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been very lethal for my child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
Dons stretch lead over Celtic to five points
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scots title race bores Dutch - de Boer
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they don't show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why?"

I'll turn things around, vows Deila
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again."
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better.
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unity.
The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
In terms of players coming in the summer, you have that pre-season period to bed them in, which you've seen with our own group this season.

Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK's rate of 5.5 per cent, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed.
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.
I cannot do that.
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.

Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.

Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.
He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.
They know it went on.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.
That really saddens me.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.
It could have had it last night.
It is a joke.

Cobram hit-and-run driver arrested
Police have arrested a man over a hit-and-run collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend.

He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident, failing to render assistance, and other traffic offences.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?
Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?
To me it's agendas.
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man gets $200k bail on drug charge
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.

Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.
Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.
Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He said he was doing it to lure them in.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying.
She saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.
It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.
In a bid to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Equally, for those not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising.
But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.
And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.
Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.
Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends.
The old adage of "getting on with it" is strong, as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems."

Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.
But while they got the points, it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Hats off to Paris.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official one to Washington, will take place on Sept. 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
Obama and Xi are expected to broach a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyberespionage and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
"The effective management of the EU's external borders is essential in order to manage migration," emphasised the ministers in the text discussed in Brussels on Monday.
Hungary imposed such measures long ago.
However, even a blind man can see that this is a domino effect.
The real black hole in the matter remains Greece.
It is an enormous, gaping hole.
Juncker's Commission promises to introduce control points as soon as possible, without stating a number or date.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for the receipt of asylum-seekers and reinforce surveillance of the islands.
"Appropriate funds will be required," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From a legal point of view, Athens will continue to have the final say.

Trpišovský ahead of Braga game: Finally the real Europe
On his European debut, Liberec coach Jindřich Trpišovský got through the Europa League qualifying rounds to reach the group stages and is now looking forward to experiencing real European competition with the team.
In the first match in the main phase of the competition, Liberec host 2011 finalists Braga, on whom they want to, according to the coach, impose their playing style.
"I'm really looking forward to it and it's real European competition - before it was just qualification," said Trpišovský at the press conference.
"They're an excellent team, one of the top teams," stated Trpišovský.
However, he doesn't consider Braga the clear favourite.
The way I see it, we're playing at home, so we're definitely not underdogs.
We'll be playing a team that will be strong on the ball, while being at the same time, for them, almost atypically disciplined.
They play a 4-4-2 system with a rapid transition to attack.
"They're very hard opponents. We did discover some weaknesses, but the most important thing will be what our players do on the pitch," said Trpišovský.
Student films take over Písek; start of international festival.
Over 351 authors from 51 countries have entered their works into this year's 15th edition of the International Student Film Festival in Písek.
The best of these will be chosen by an international jury, says festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Every year the festival has its own theme, based on the festival's theme tune.
The director of this year's gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre in them.
"And obviously we have to solve the crime that was committed in this year's trailer," says Charvát.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting student films - live-action, animated and documentaries.
Films will be judged by an international jury including, for example, last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
Visitors will be able to see Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbochanson group Poletíme?, playful group Zrní and Petra Hapková with a recital of "Život na baru".
The festival will also include two photography exhibitions.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron of the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy (FAMO) in Písek, who recently passed away.
The festival is associated with the creation of the Private College of Film-making in Písek.
Up until the sixth edition it took place once every two years.
The Ministry for Regional Development continues to insist upon the amendment, arguing in terms of consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to stop insuring travel agencies if the amendment is passed.
as without insurance they will have to either close or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Karla Šlechtová (ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies do not meet claims in full go against European law,
Šlechtová emphasised that insurance companies would receive sufficient information on the running of travel agencies and would be able to set the correct limit.
"While we appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, it must have such a limit as to be feasible," countered TOP 09 deputy chairman Miroslav Kalousek.
Kalousek claims that bank guarantees won't work as no-one will give unlimited guarantees.
"Travel agencies will have to either close down or move abroad," he warned.
They will, however, determine whether travel agencies will be able to make some contribution, which would not, according to Okamura, be a problem.
"Consumer protection works," judges Fischerová.
Her proposal to delete the disputed passage was not passed by the Chamber of Deputies.
Also unsuccessful was Vojtěch Filip (KSČM), whose proposal to return the document to the committee stage due to an alleged conflict with the Civil Code did not pass, either.
Filip highlighted the tour operators, who he said could threaten the consumer.
The amendment is also to address the funding of the mountain rescue service.
Furthermore, according to the Association a change in current practice is effectively superfluous.
This year only three travel agencies closed down.
This was contained in a statement by Angela Merkel following discussions with German state premiers.
At the same time she again appealed for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among member states.
People must know as soon as possible whether they have a chance to stay here.
More teachers will be required to teach refugees German.
During Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.
"When we're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.
"I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown initially said.
The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted their directing could "end up giving us something we don't want."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.
"Albums still matter," he said.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finisher, the one with the fastest time gets it," said Weed.
I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.
After Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth, Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and provide new room for economic growth, Xi said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses.

The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
More hospital beds possible in Karlovy Vary Region
According to deputy governor of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current bed capacity of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial modifications should be implemented on the basis of agreements between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, in the region there are options for expanding the care offered.
The concept recommends that part of this facility function as a rehabilitation ward and part as a classic LCC ward.
As it notes, after-care wards are chiefly absent in Karlovy Vary Hospital,
Last but not least, the Karlovy Vary Region lacks social care wards focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
New services could also be offered in psychiatric care.
