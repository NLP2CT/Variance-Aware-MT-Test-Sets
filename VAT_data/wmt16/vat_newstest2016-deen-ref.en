Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.
He was quite the heartthrob back then.
All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.
Police said the dog was OK.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together in the occasional gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
There was no sign of anything amiss.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of wit about them.
Classes resume Wednesday.
This is a day of healing.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
Toys R Us Plans to Hire Fewer Holiday Season Workers
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
While the holidays themselves are months away, holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
It was noteworthy because of personal reasons, too.

8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
And these numbers hold up in early states.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
The only candidate who beats him?
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.

Incidentally, for once Munich is not in the lead.
Champions League: Bayern off to a dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
With his 28th goal in the Champions League, Müller took Bayern into the lead with the gracious help of Olymiacos goalie Roberto, who let through a cross shot from the world champion.
"We aren't going to underestimate them," promised Bayern captain Phillipp Lahm before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich player kept his word.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund stumbled here too.
Attacks were too often initiated by bringing left winger Douglas Costa, who rarely got past former Brunswick player Omar Elabdellaoui, into play.
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal.
In the 67th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in the first half.
First when Olympiacos striker Ideye Brown hit the Pole's header from the line in the 26th minute.
Although Bayern is used to playing a dominant game, Piraeus were able to needle them.
But they could count on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
For example when he steered a shot from Ideye over the crossbar in the 56th minute.
Mario Götze, back in the squad following muscle problems, initially sat on the sidelines.
The world cup hero had only been given the green light following final training, said Sporting Director Matthias Sammer on Sky: "If anyone wants to make something else out of that, they are being malicious".
At the first change, Guardiola decided against him, when he brought in Kingsley Coman for the stricken Lewandowski in the 59th minute.
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal in the 76th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later; Müller put another one in with a penalty.
Before the match there was a riot in the stadium.
Smokers at a greater risk of losing teeth
Smokers damage not only their lungs but also their teeth, concludes a long-term study in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely is between 2.5 and 3.6 times higher for smokers.
The scientists monitored more than 23,300 participants.
The main reasons for tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE states.
It has not been clarified to what extent smoking raises the risk of caries.
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age.
The new long term study substantiates these findings.

EU Commission proposes new court in controversy over TTIP
The Swede plans to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
They should come in equal proportions from the EU, the USA and from non-member countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also provided for.
This would allow for appeals to be made against judgements.
In the long term, according to her statement, she wants to aim at an international investment court.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticised by adversaries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax payers, make national laws null and void, or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental protection standards.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules.
Small and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, they said.
Negotiations have been taking place since the middle of 2013.
The issue of investor protection, however, has to date not been discussed with the USA.
This date is no longer tenable.
Exquisite folk from Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Prime Club (now Luxor) in Cologne.
Beside him stands a flip chart on which the shy-seeming folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan in felt-tip pen.
Where they originated, and what it looks like, in his home country.
Since then Stevens has proved himself to be a wonderfully creative nutcase.
One year later the New York-based musician returns to his series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come On Feel The Illinoise") in 2005, a widely acclaimed masterpiece is released.
Exuberant with ideas and stylistic sophistication.
Currently Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-man band.
Hamburg Mehr kept in the dark!
Without directing a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
Only with his encore does Stevens give his modest thanks, play a few of his older songs acoustically and finally take a bow to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.

Between May and July, UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
The rate was the fastest since 2009, and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6,229.21.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.
JD Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But that spending power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs at his firm, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer extra jobs.
Justin Bieber, megastar.
The guy with the platinum blond hair is worth a hundred million euros.
Probably even more.
At the moment Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carlton.

"I'm fulfilling her dream for her."
Compulsory education?
Not the fans.
Nor Bieber himself.
And for every doll that looks like him and passes over the counter Bieber cashes in as well.
Others point out that after all Bieber is charting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose new album is due out in November, is not interested in all those zeros.

Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "highly, probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he hasn't ever had an issue with the other players, he's well respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
And I think Nick, he's risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
As a police helicopter hovered above, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
Hungary, however, was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.
They got across by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws.
Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.
Biden does the best of the three on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
But it's a different story among the American public overall.
The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.

Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
"At this point, members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity's well-being over that of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.
For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.

However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future, or spending licence fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending
'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.

Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca
Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.
Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque, part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials ordered one million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury
Resulting in 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at tradesmen, opening
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain's FTSE100 index of leading firms, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
According to senior Public Prosecutor Robert Riffel, it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defendants used monies from the club's accounts, to which they had access due to their roles, for private purposes.
The sports officials are also accused of financial offences.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he had then resolved to undertake this task.
With all the risks.
Furthermore, if there was appropriate financial success, retrospective payment of the expense allowance back to 1991 was agreed.
Those were reserves, explained the defendant.
"Why?" the Judge wanted to know.
There was no answer to this for a long time.
Had something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money, the State Prosecutor put to the room.
The co-defendant knew about it, the official justified himself.
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
The official carried on that he had never received a cent in salary, he had only charged for mileage and a per diem allowance.
The second defendant had also obtained a mileage allowance.
All adjustments were made in cash, for which he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
Hewlett Packard cutting a further 30,000 jobs
There seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP).
At the end of trading Hewlett-Packard shares had fallen by 2.3 percent.
In the third fiscal quarter to the end of July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Revenue dropped by eight percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters.
Twenty-four percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Cars: Second press day at the 66th IAA
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition, whose motto is "Mobility Connects", on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
He reported by telephone:
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
A pregnant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area.
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
Delta State University shooter left note of apology
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.
Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, bailed out on foot, ran into the woods and shot and killed himself.

Eurowings: Lufthansa reconstructing group
Meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is reorganising the structure of its business and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The goal of the realignment is a contribution to profits of around €500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
The Eurowings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the management board headed by Carsten Spohr.
With this new realignment Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Up to now the organisation of the 120,000 employees has been extremely complex.
The airline is consolidating the passenger airline group, which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of €30 billion, under one umbrella.
This was announced by the union.
Under discussion will be the pilots' retirement scheme.

It's one thing any parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.

"Set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," it reads, chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.

There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.
Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.
The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.

So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.
They included the medley of tax-shy rascals, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers.
The press never forgave him that either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.
But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless?
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.
The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.
"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future.
The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, admittedly made in-house.
Frankly other channels would give their right arm for it.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful were shown on TV, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online.
'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.
"We believe that, using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The adverts shaming Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms fair video.
Horrific killer drones!
Ankle-shattering leg irons!
Cluster bombs!
And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof, produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."

VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US army for "the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."

Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, according to the Künstlerhaus on Tuesday.
In Meng the Künstlerhaus has lost an honourary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," it is reported.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Meng studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the second World War.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasury chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the renovation of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.

Dr Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests €310,000
Sylvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over practice from Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
"When we were ready, I simply called them up."
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"We want to get to know the families and support them over the years."
He also sees being his own boss as a benefit.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers would buy the house with the practice.
However in the meantime they are living in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice will be preparing for the new boss.
The Müllers, both specialists in internal medicine, wanted to establish themselves as general practitioners.
"So it's out with the endoscopy," says 38-year-old Sylvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress EKGs and we need one more consulting room.
The IT system will also be completely renewed.
There is another GP practice in Asendorf.
Frank Müller says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice: according to Ursel Felstehausen, the chemist will stay in Asendorf.
If they hadn't found any successor, it would have closed down.
With their leaving, an era ends in Asendorf; after all the doctors have had their practice there for 30 years.
"But we'll still be living in Hohenmoor and I'm sure we will be seeing many of our patients often," says the internal medicine specialist.
Her husband adds with a smile, "We've got a 6000 m² garden."
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy travelling.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
It is equally clear "that obvious signals are needed," says the minister.
People must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration, and not over the Austrian-Slovenian border either.
The Croatian government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany, and also potentially establish corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see it in quite the same light.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby maize field.
Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic says that his country is expecting around 4000 refugees in the next few days.
The detainees were travelling the entire night through Serbia from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometres away.
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007, since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned.
According to media reports from Belgrade, they spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
At the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved.
Aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes.
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers has been sent to the border region.

FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming over them at one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further," she said.
There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.
Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
The health of the global economy isn't one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be factored into its decision-making.
But, in effect, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.

Exceptions for the new Bernried sports hall
Bernried district council has approved the planning application for the €2.3 million sports hall.
According to this a "gable roof with an off-centre ridge and roof overhang" will be constructed.
The "exemption" on the other hand refers to the roof pitch, which for energy reasons - contrary to the stipulations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees.
The hall at the sports centre is a joint project between the district and SV Bernried.
Costs have been calculated at around €2.3 million.
In the next step of the project, the planning application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will be presented to the district administration for review.
Peissenberg Clinic moves to Schongau.
The Peissenberg Hospital is closing earlier than planned – in 2016.
At the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The wards and the majority of employees are moving to Schongau from Peissenberg.
If these plans are implemented, then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peissenberg will remain in employment.
Those employees who are not able to go to Schongau will be offered positions in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiss.
When the question of who his successor should be, according to Jochner-Weiss, the name of "Fischer", who had declared that he was prepared to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to Schongau, was raised.
For the Schongau hospital, these changes mean an "upgrade" and an expansion of the services offered in the field of internal medicine, says Jochner-Weiss.
Fisher is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological disorders in its internal medicine department.
In the transitionary period over the next two years Fischer and his team, if the Board of Management agrees to this, will run both establishments, and in the next year the former miners' hospital in Peissenberg, which still has over 35 beds, will finally be closed after almost 140 years.
Thus far the district has planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing restoration of the Weilheim hospital is finished.
District administrator Jochner-Weiss, who is also Chairman of the Board of Management, contradicts rumours that the building, which is owned by the Federal Association for Miners, will in the future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
At the moment a Caritas short-term care facility and a daytime psychiatric facility are housed there.
Real prospects for the building where Fischer has worked for over 30 years as chief physician do not really exist.

Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
And more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
This is the conclusion reached by a study commissioned by the "Social Housing" federation of associations.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial reception accommodation.
There is a current shortfall in urban areas of around 770,000 living units laments Matthias Günther, author of the study.
This is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing" alliance suggests a fresh start.
For example land transfer tax could be waived and the land tax for sponsored housing temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the association, attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary.
Refugees have safe conduct: Croatia and Slovenia put corridor in place
However the route is dangerous.
Hungary had cordoned off its borders for refugees the previous day.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through.
According to media reports most come from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
At the Croatian-Serbian border the refugees did not come across border fences.
The border strips hold other dangers: there are still active mines there from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 90s.
It is now planned for minesweepers to quickly create a safe passage.
The new Hungarian laws classify climbing and damaging the border fences as criminal offences.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
In practice, however, nobody else has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to opinion in Hungary, Serbia is "a safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers will be deported there.
Workers have begun to clean up in Röszke.
Crowd barriers are being dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border town is being rebuilt.
No one wants to talk about the goal of this rebuilding.

Mayor drives "stranded people" over the border
Before that we entertained our surprise guests with snacks and drinks.

"We were very pleased about that," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had changed trains in Wels on Sunday evening from an ICE train to a regional train to Passau after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended, in an attempt to cross the border anyway.
But the regional train was stopped before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, excursions over the border are generally very popular.
It will be a huge challenge, in the light of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for asylum seekers.
Konrad has his hands full with the hosting of refugees.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word carries weight.
The government has engaged the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to establish accommodation for thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got to grips with the chaos in the Traiskirchen reception centre.
"We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first achievement.
The Minister of the Interior, however, talked of a "critical situation".
If there are more refugees, we can manage.
"But it is not a bottomless pit," says Konrad.
He has already carried out talks with the State Governors.
"It is going well in Austria," says Ferry Maier.
In times of need it should not be necessary for those providing accommodation to have to comply with certain heights for towel rails or sizes of skylights.
"Emergency standards" should apply for a limited period.

The braggart from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are known as braggarts.
This characteristic also connects many with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
This is also something that happens in the Palatine town of Kallstadt, from where the property billionaire's grandparents originate.
The New Yorker with the blow-dry hairstyle is a concept to many in the winemaking village on the wine route.
Many in the village of 1,200 inhabitants are related to him.
And what do the inhabitants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world?
Trump, who is not known for his modesty, also gets a chance to speak in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway, even had he lived in Kallstadt.
They would not let Trump enter as he had originally left without authorisation, the Director of the Institute for Palatinate History and Cultural Anthropology, Roland Paul, explains at the beginning of the film.
This is at odds with the sometimes pithy statements of his descendant.
"The fuss he makes about it is not very nice," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("My grandmother was born a Trump, my grandfather was born a Heinz").
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine it," says the 72-year-old.
"He has never had any interest in Kallstadt."
"I can't imagine Donald doing that," says the 68-year-old.
If anyone like him had been in charge in his grandfather's time, "he would never have gone there".
"He's certainly not my president," she says.
And, "the grapes will ripen without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump gave a lengthy interview, has been seen by 12,000 cinema-goers, and interest is also growing in the USA.

Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international telecasts which also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
Today scored a slight uptick compared to its ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but its figure was behind last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning folks!

Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered that with a resounding "yes."
Seven's The X Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings drop will have Nine quietly confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5.30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to dent McGuire's show.

Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one.
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
"Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn't just a game - I'm wholeheartedly invested in him now," she said.
And asked who Wood should choose if not her, she was enigmatic.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday, 7.30pm on Ten.

But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
49ers beat reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play.
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.
Very different main topics were originally planned.
"Bavaria deports; others don't."
Stronger Wall Street gives Dax a helping hand
It was only in the afternoon that a stronger rally on the US stock market provided a clearer direction which ultimately lifted the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The value of MDax medium size companies gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
The technology-heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1,736.69 points.
The markets in London and Paris also registered solid gains.
In the USA the Dow Jones index closed at about 1 percent up.
According to the "Spiegel", the German energy companies potentially lack €30 billion in reserves.
Thus investment in the promising wafer technology and a focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Stocks on Volkswagen increased in price by 1.26 percent.
The Rex bond index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.
10, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The plot of land at the Alte Post youth centre in Emden is going to be built on again.
The town is currently making preparations to market the 4000 square metre area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - although there are no firm offers so far.
Emden - The town of Emden wants to sell a plot of land of around 4000 square metres directly adjacent to the Alte Post youth centre.
Preparations are currently underway.
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
Consequently, no contract has yet been concluded.
Plans for the holiday home development at the Kleines Meer near Emden are taking shape.
The interested party, the Emden company "System-Bau", presented their plans to the Emden Council development committee for the first time on Monday evening.
The €10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months.
Roberto Schulz, property owner and member of the board of the residents' lobby group, Pro Hieve, claims: "It's going to be a huge development which looms over all the other buildings".
"First of all we have to present a coherent concept," says Ralf Behrends.
Twin gorillas born in Frankfurt Zoo
Twenty-six year old Dian brought twins into the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare for gorillas.
The last time it happened in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago in 1967, also in Frankfurt, according to the zoo.
The sex of the new-born gorilla twins is not yet certain as so far mother Dian has kept a close hold on them.
NHC says 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
"Our journey involved many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
Meanwhile, the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.
In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.
"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.
This is what happens in the recently published novel "We're not really like that" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story itself, the novel may be of interest to every reader in Hunsrück as it is set in Langweiler and the surrounding location.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is happy to have been able to create a literary monument to her native area.

Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.
There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been very lethal for my child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
Villingen-Schwenningen: three vehicles damaged

I'll turn things around, vows Deila
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
Defeat to Malmo and subsequent Champions League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-man Aberdeen, who now sit five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again."
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unity.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu in retirement hint
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has dropped hints that he could retire when his contract with the Swans is up.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a troublesome ankle for two years, and failed to find a move away from Wales in the summer.
Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was dismissed and went on to lose 3-2, but the defender's red card was later overturned - the third Collum red card in eight months to be rescinded.
Neilson is sticking with what he said, insisting: "I didn't question any integrity, I didn't comment on a performance."

Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.
I cannot do that.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
I will just have to try to remember all the details.
I complained to her.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.
I won't go over all the details again here.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.
Man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a safer tactic - "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.
He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."
They know it went on.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
Should that make me think it's becoming personal?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.
I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.
It could have had it last night.
It had it on race day.
Cobram hit-and-run driver arrested
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident, failing to render assistance, and other traffic offences.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?
Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?
To me it's agendas.
But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear, he warned.
The cab of the driver responsible for the accident was completely torn apart.
Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.
Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.
Traffickers move towards Germany over minor border crossings.
More than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the border river of Inn in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had arrived on foot over bridges and weirs on the German side.
They are received there by Federal police and passed on for registration.
According to reports from the Federal police, significantly more refugees arrived at the main railway station in Munich on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
Following the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian borders, 1,759 refugees reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: tail end of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the south west
The powerful trough is the tail end of tropical storm "Henry", which has moved over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in the last few days.
According to DWD, gusts of between 60 and 90 kilometres per hour can be anticipated on the Swabian Mountains and in Bodenseekreis.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Unlike its most important competitors, VW Golf and Ford Focus, for the first time the Opel Astra is only available as a five door.
Renault Mégane: Renault introduces the fourth generation of its competitor to the Astra, the Mégane, into the race.
The Mégane can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-door, in a conventional and a distinctly sporty version.
The Nissan offshoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fits right into the design line of the brand.
His liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of unsuitable prison conditions however, failed.
Otherwise there would be "fears of deterioration of a person's right to protection".
Berlin prisons have also hit the headlines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff.
That is twice as many as are being built at the moment (250,000 homes).
To date there is still no adequate supply of general and work-related language courses.
To be able to convince families of the benefits of kindergartens, the administration is issuing leaflets in a number of languages.
However they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of these, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
Refugees with a residence permit or protection against deportation no longer receive benefits according to the asylum seekers benefits act if they begin a course of study.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have and the existing state-church law should be developed into a state-religion relationship.
Rights also involve responsibilities.
Those who want to wage such conflict in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to stay here in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
"As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we can cope," he told the Tagesspiegel.
Services provided can be accounted for with the Federal states later.
Up to now, as Berlin health researcher Thea Borde has established, migrants have received poorer information about their illnesses than other patients.
And with a different diagnostic view.
To be allowed to practice, however, they must prove their qualifications and possibly take more exams.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer among other things from so-called flashbacks, difficulties in breathing, dizziness, palpitations and fear of death.
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, nervousness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, explained Munz.
Up to now, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
The ring invites you to dream
The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of mesmerising acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now Circus Probst is issuing an invitation to dream in the ring at the Ziegelwasen.
"I couldn't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal trainer and junior manager.
The circus has been owned by the Probst family for over 33 years.
Distinguished at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov clown family captivate the public with wit and charm.
Lightness and agility - these words sum them up.
Balancing on a ball with a unicycle?
No problem for He Yuan.
Contortionists enthrall and terrify at the same time.
Wang Lin, from China, is better acquainted with the oldest form of acrobatics than most and thrills with his flexibility.
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to go in the ring either.
So the top priority is to look after the animals well.
The Probst family are especially proud of their zebroid, Jumbo - the offspring of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
There is something for every visitor.
Circus Probst invites you to come and see their show every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
The programme begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday.
Thursday is family day; there is a discount on the price of the show.
And the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.
That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.
"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
It is nothing major.
This was just an accident.
It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph.
It has never been done at Arsenal.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
Friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of "healthy mood" friends, their chances of recovering doubled.
Equally, for those not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation is king.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship.
As much as my objective, outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friend network.
And so, if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with the sets fully redesigned in celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.
That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Hats off to Paris.
It was a magnificent match from them.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday.
The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share, which marked a 2.4-percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
Concerns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have slashed iron ore prices by roughly a half, as coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Washington Visit
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official one to Washington, will take place on Sept. 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
"President Xi's visit will present an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional, and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while also enabling President Obama and President Xi to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington, before going on to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly on Sept.
Obama and Xi are expected to broach a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyberespionage and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car rented and written off
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfil a dream and rented a Ford Mustang.
He got a rude awakening on the wet motorway.
So the 29-year-old from the Gotha district did just that.
The end of his dream came on the A 71 motorway near Arnstadt.
The sports car was a write-off but no one was injured.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has played for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, twice club world champion, twice European champion, one time world champion - Xavi's list of titles is breath-taking.
In the summer the then 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Qatar and the al-Sadd Sport Club.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted to have me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have turned out if Xavi had left.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn't needed behind the scenes.
During Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.
"When we're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.
"I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown initially said.
The only black character who's a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp.
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval over Damon's comments.
Damon's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
So to all of a sudden...like I can't even imagine what it's going to be like...the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course, won't be awarded any prize money.
By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finisher, the one with the fastest time gets it," said Weed.
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he does get the great gratification.
I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed.
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the bullpen to throw every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.
The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.

After this they should be redistributed to other communities.
Due to the large number of refugees, emergency shelter has also been set up in sports halls in Frankfurt and Hanau.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
"I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European nations of "collectively looking the other way".
Four years ago one would have been happy for the chalice of military involvement to pass Germany by.
"Now the conflict has come crashing down at our front door," he said on the German World Service.
Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
Nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria.
She gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague, Werner Faymann, together with a number of other EU states and heads of government, are proposing a special summit for next week.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it.
But those who have no prospects of permanent residency will not be able to stay in Germany.
On Monday night Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia.

"Cassini" space probe finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the icy crust of Saturn's moon Enceladus splashes a global ocean.
This is the reason the moon wobbles slightly in its orbit of the ringed planet.
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under Enceladus's crust of ice.
"Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes, which spew water vapour and ice particles that feed the so-called E ring of Saturn, at the south pole of this moon in 2006.
The extent of the hidden ocean was however not clear.
1860 Munich must do without attacking midfielder Valdet Rama for about a month.
An examination revealed that the 27-year-old has suffered an adductor injury, the club revealed.
Rama had complained of pain at the beginning of the week.
"We have to think about it of course," Sports Director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper, regarding the possible engagement of a professional who is not attached to a club.
The Austrian international should be getting back to training runs on Thursday.
Mangoes are exotic, juicy and sweet.
Because mangoes have a relatively high sugar content – primarily sucrose.
The exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But most of all mangoes are full of vitamin A and its precursor, beta-carotene.
A mango also gives a special touch even to savoury dishes.
They mitigate the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radicchio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The company has already started to recruit seasonal workers, UPS reported on Tuesday.

The foehn will break through in the valleys on the northen side of the Alps in the coming night, Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
In places the foehn may advance into the adjacent midland, and on the mountains gale force winds of over 120 km/h are even possible.
In conjunction with the cold front, the wind will get stronger increasing to stormy, and temperatures will decrease sharply.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Some 500 years after the Reformation, Rome now has a Martin Luther Square.
In the presence of the Mayor of the City, Ignazio Marino, a hitherto unnamed square in the park on the Oppio Hill was on Wednesday bestowed with the name of the German reformer.
At the time he considered the city to be a degenerate hotbed of vice.
Luther heralded the beginning of the Western Church with his theses against the selling of indulgences.
Klaus Altepost has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bible.
The 75-year-old conceived his "language" with bright colours and imaginative forms - which are however by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
Cycles evolved, dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, the Commandments or the Lord's Prayer.
And in particular author Klaus Altepost, who has grappled with the particular Bible passages based on the paintings.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's paintings.
Symbolism has been driven out.
Artists have a different passion and joy in presenting things.
Otmar Alt wants his viewers to let themselves "fall into" the pictures, to let them leave their impression, to discover and experience the power they have: "The picture is looking for its counterpart".
"This wasn't a collaboration between partners," says Altepost, "it was about the pictures; the text is merely an explanation." The result is a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther Verlag this work is an invitation "to add depth to his life and to find freedom".
Some of the originals - paper and canvas - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15th November in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction draws closer for BMX track

Football can and will help.
But the politicians must set the deciding guidelines.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" to four years.
Several teams are also supporting the programme.
This very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words "We are helping – #refugeeswelcome" on the left sleeve of their strip instead of the usual sponsor's logo (Hermes).
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, nobody can look away."
"We football teams can, no, we must use our charisma, our influence, and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremendously," says Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a prominent signal by the league.
The women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle (Saale) for the World Cup qualifying match against Hungary.
It is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this.
The message "1:0 for a welcome," that we have sent out is being lived in football.
In an accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA after midnight, he fell on a water glass he was carrying in his left hand, reported the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
The 54-year-old manager will be at the meeting and "fully fit for work".
"I am definitely there for SAP, completely involved in my job."
McDermott normally commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has no longer been in the SAP German headquarters in Walldorf.

Robot cars: Government wants Germany to take a leading role
The Transport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile broadband and a rapid switch to digital radio.
However driverless vehicles "are not anticipated until 2020" on public roads.
Nevertheless, 15 percent could imagine this happening on motorways in free-flowing traffic and 45 percent in traffic jams.
Approximately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances.
The final decision will be made on 22 September.
"But we are strong enough to pick up the title without Timo," said national coach Jörg Rosskopf during European Championship training in Dusseldorf.
At this time Boll was on a flight to a long arranged appointment with sponsors in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo we have the disadvantage of no longer being the clear favourites," declared individual European champion Dimitrij Ovcharov.
But the Hamelin player, who is the top seed in Ekaterinburg, also remembers the European Championship in Schwechat in 2013.
"That is what we need to focus on," declared the world number five.
In the course of the tackle in the Champions League game with PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and after a long bout of treatment was replaced.
Initial diagnosis indicates that the 20-year-old who used to play with Bastian Schweinsteiger has broken his tibia.
Gaultier feels too old to be an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a waxworks chamber of horrors: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins which look alarmingly human thanks to video projection.
“It used to be bleached, nowadays it's real,” says Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition, "From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk", which can be seen in the Kunsthalle at the Hypo Culture Foundation from 1 September, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluctant attitude to a show about his own character.
Originally he was against it because, "For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
It's about a lot more than beautiful clothes," says the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits provide an insight into the hard to overlook work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education.
Shortly before the start of Oktoberfest there was also a special treat in store: a Lederhosen outfit with a corset.
Even Gaultier's old teddy is on show in the exhibition.
He represents the designer's first, tentative steps at fashion.
As a child (he was not a good pupil and he was bad at football), he dressed his teddy in bras and dresses.
His parents did not allow him to play with dolls.
Later he taught himself fashion design.
He stole fashion magazines and scrutinised other designers' creations, Gaultier told us in Munich.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Decoration instead of curtains – Plauen lace as a fashion niche
There used to be long embroidery machines in and around Plauen making many metres
Instead, fashion is once more important.
Generally, so-called vintage fashion, based on style eras from the past, is producing an increasing potential for orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other businesses, is a member of the Plauener Spitze und Stickereien trade association.
Only they are allowed to bear the protected label.
This is enough reason for new directions.
Reinhardt added, "This also applies to the materials we use".
This is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers.
A few years ago textile designer Kati Reuter revitalised the historic snowball lace.
Plauen master goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this. "In the past I had no use for traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball lace for her jewellery.
Using an elaborate process she embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with Plauen lace – young and old," says Reuter.
She also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland – primarily to customers whose forefathers lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want to have a memento.
So with my jewellery I see myself as a modern ambassador for Plauen lace.
It is about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family in the time of the Great Depression in England.
Xi urges to open economy wider to world
Promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and provide new room for economic growth, Xi said.
According to the statement, a negative list, identifying sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment, will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs.
In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
Guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double the mercury limit in predatory fish
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits for the neurotoxin for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example shark or swordfish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 mg of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
Once the limit has been doubled, however, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this relaxation the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 mg to 0.1 mg of mercury per kilogram.
Mercury is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accumulates largely in the food chain, above all in predatory fish.
In the past year, Europe-wide alerts on mercury in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
Foodwatch is calling for consumers to protest against the EU plans under: www.quecksilber-aktion.foodwatch.de
