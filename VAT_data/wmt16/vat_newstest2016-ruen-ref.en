The cost of discounted travel for citizens will amount to 1/2 the fare of the applicable carrier.
The other half of the fare will be paid for from the regional budget.
Moreover, it becomes possible to refund loaded but unspent funds.
It's also worth noting that the system of mutual settlements with carriers will become transparent, since a citizen now pays for half of the fare, and the carrier will be reimbursed in the exact same amount from the budget.
No commission fee will be charged for loading funds onto the card.
In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.
All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
Police said the dog was OK.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
There was no sign of anything amiss.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
Classes resume Wednesday.

8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets stated that the government is now looking at approaches to implementing the law on indexing pensions in 2016 to the real rate of inflation, reports Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings equals 350 billion roubles.
Why do eyelids often become irritated and red?
Ophthalmologist, Tatiana Levashova, answers:
When forgetting to regularly clean our eyelids, often we ourselves contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The solution is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, and carry a special moist cloth with you for your eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the lid from the harmful substances that have accumulated on them over the course of the day.
It is useful to compliment these cleaning procedures with warm compresses that contain an infusion of medicinal herbs (sage, camomile), which thin out the thick secretions from the sebaceous glands, followed by a massage of the edges of the lids using the fingertips in circular movements;
when removing make-up, don't use products that contain alcohol.

Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.
He has called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly showpiece.
He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.
Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.

Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should've decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid."
While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
He's a great team around him, he's got a great family around him and I just think he's been a little hard done by.
"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor-wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.
We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
But it's a different story among the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson draws close behind Donald Trump in national poll

"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.
He could not be revived and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.
This we know.
What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.
For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.
That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
There are, indeed, multiple variables at play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.
Hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yield," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 rate hikes, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending
Experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.
Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.
The news agency's English service did not report that detail, but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad.
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.
The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury
At same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
If you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls, it seems you are in the minority these days.
Veronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is behind the trend.
Currently the majority of staff are men.
Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women, including its chief executive and finance director.
Decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
"Open up!" chant hundreds of refugees at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border to immigrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to test out other possible routes into the EU.
Another is through Croatia and Slovenia into Austria.
Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs Nebojša Stefanović pledged that his country was doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but that it had limited resources:
It will not be easy to solve; no country in Europe can deal with it on its own, especially such a small country as Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is uncompromising:
And if they don't do this, then they will not be permitted to enter our country, because it is completely safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence along the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not content to stop there: he plans on erecting a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Evangelos Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us".

Evangelos Meimarakis: Greece has changed and we have too.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
All of this would have been lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
We were told that Tsipras' ministers never spoke about this.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table as Mr. Juncker, Mr. Hollande, Ms. Merkel, and other European leaders.
Will what you say to them differ in any way from what your predecessor, Anthony Samaras, said to them?
We pushed forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we were operating under extraordinary circumstances.
Euronews: Over the past weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been moving across Greek territory.
Evangelos Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb that we will be forced to deal with after our election victory.
These are victims of the war in Syria: victims of certain extreme events that have happened to them.
An appropriate decision should be made at the EU summit and it should also involve the United Nations.
Euronews: Mister Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He was crying.
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two legs.

The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June.

It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I am so sorry.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than this?
"Set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," it reads, chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
Most likely, such a relatively lowly PR task would have been outsourced to an aide, seemingly one who has never read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
I wouldn't rule out an away win, either.

A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.
Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit.
He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.
He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.

Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before.

'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.

At the same time, the head of the White House isn't yet ready to talk about this with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ media.
The publication PJ media reports on this.
Nevertheless, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, that is when he will pick up the phone and try to make that call".
Barack Obama himself believes that Russia's decision the increase support for the Assad regime is "a losing bet".
Yelena Lashkina, aide to the Minister of Economic Development, reported this to Izvestia.
This matter was submitted for consideration by the sub-commission on customs tariffs, non-tariff regulation, and protective measures in foreign trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which held a meeting in September, and, following the discussion, it was also approved by the government agencies.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional exemption at the time of importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following approval of the meeting minutes of the sub-commission by the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will present the proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion by member states of the EEU, Lashkina explained.
The Ministry of Transportation has given orders to the captains of seaports in Crimea to ensure the administration of the simplified procedures for the entry of small-sized, sport sailboats, and recreational watercraft into the seaport and for the departure of the above-listed vessels from the seaport.

The issue is that yachting is very difficult in Russia because of poorly developed infrastructure.

Prisons are asked to create separate blocs for transgender people.
A member of the council, Vladislav Grib, spoke to Izvestia about this.
Vladislav Grib is sure that separating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving out their sentences.
Currently, this is the only way of dealing with these types of criminals.
The humiliation of trans people by their cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Separate pre-trial detention facilities aren't necessary, just separate cells, and blocs in prisons.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and in the media, since, as of yet, there is no procedure in Russia for holding transgender people in pre-trial detention facilities and penal colonies.
Given the climate in Russian prisons, this is the correct recommendation.

The end of the championship turned out to be more than a little intriguing.
The winner was only decided in the final round, and it was Russian Mikhail Antipov who managed to finally overtake the Pole, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who looked set to claim the title.
Among the girls, victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player, Natalia Buksa.
After all, Antipov absolutely had to win in the 13th round in order to surpass the leader.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player ended the stand-off against the Dutchman in a draw.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol didn't enable her to surpass Buksa.
The Russian athlete placed second, just half a point behind the champion.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not be similar to ration cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Yevtukhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be similar to the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
I'd especially like to note that the proposed grocery cards shouldn't be confused with memories of widespread shortages from times past, or of a card system of distribution in which the quantity of goods is rationed.
Earlier, Kommersant wrote that the programme to introduce food cards for low-income individuals had been submitted to the government.
For more details on the Ministry of Industry and Trade's initiative, read the Kommersant article "Igor Shuvalov orders the preparation of food cards".

10-13% is a comfortable rate for investment loans.
In your opinion, what is the situation like today?
The reason is obvious: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Financing at 25-30% per annum wasn't beneficial to anyone.
For the business community, the current level of interest rates for loans to SMEs isn't comfortable.
The situation improved slightly after the Central Bank lowered the interest rate.
Credit resources became more readily available.
Today, businesses have one option: they need to learn how to operate by focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It's necessary to more closely monitor current performance and control cash flow.
Which main trends in the SME lending market will become more pronounced and will influence its development up until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
However, there's no point in waiting for a drastic decline in the cost of credit for SMEs.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.

Kiev breaks up the atomic union.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovnaya Rada, during a second attempt, ultimately voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovnaya Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the agreement concluded with the Russian Federation between 2010-2012 to construct the third and fourth blocks of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
According to the original plans, the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, which was initiated during the Soviet period, was to consist of four 1 GW power units with pressurised water reactors, but only two were ever built.
Negotiations with Moscow on completing construction led to the signing of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010; while between 2011-2012, the Rada adopted the relevant legislation.
Since funds from Ukraine's budget weren't available, it was assumed that the block would be constructed using loans provided by the Russian side, but funds were never allocated.
Ban Ki-moon also stated that a meeting would be held with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council about the situation in Syria.
Right now, there are no such plans.
"But anything could happen", said Mr. Bogdanovsky.

He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement and "a return to normal life in our countries".
Mandates allotted to parties.
As per usual, many complaints about violations during the elections were heard from representatives of the CPRF, who accused the electoral commission of "concealing fraud".
The opposition's objections were not accepted.
Altogether, 1.03 mln people were included on the voters list for Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand voting ballots were issued at precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voters cast their ballots in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were determined to be void, while 24 remain unaccounted for.
Yesterday, 12 seats were allocated among political parties according to the votes they received.
According to United Russia's lists, six deputy seats go to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
Two seats for the CPRF were allocated to Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma Deputy, Aleksandr Tarnaev.
Three seats for A Just Russia went to Aleksandr Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov, and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Chairman for the city electoral commission, Aleksandr Makeev, informed members of the commission that he was establishing shifts to "dispatch telegrams to Zhirinovsky and the others" for the purpose of refusing their mandates.
Upon approval of the protocol on the results of the election, representatives from the CPRF filed complaints about multiple violations.
"Then the head of the administration was corrected, and interested parties were permitted to attend all meetings", retorted Natalia Andryushina, member of the city electoral commission.
The opposition was also outraged that, on election day, several precinct electoral commissions started to seal ballot boxes at between 6 and 7 o'clock the morning, placing early voting ballots inside of them.
However, according to Aleksandr Makeev, the city electoral commission, which has already investigated more than 124 various complaints, didn't find any violations involving the stuffing of ballot boxes with unaccounted for ballots.
The electoral commission must confirm the overall results of the elections by September 27, after which, within a period of three weeks, the first meeting of the sixth convocation of the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma will be announced.
According to the documents, the party members were planning on bringing up two issues for discussion with residents of Nizhny Novgorod: do you agree that the collection of fees for capital repairs to apartment blocks should be "immediately cancelled", and should rates for housing and communal services "be frozen until 2020".
FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In the latest quarter, ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Borodai dubs the US newspaper's information as libel against Strelkov.
He spoke about this in a telephone interview with a correspondent from Lenta.ru.
According to Borodai, there definitely was talk about Strelkov during the conversation with the reporter from the US newspaper.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov needed to be immediately removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic", said the former head of government for the DPR.
If it's not a provocation, then it's a surprising case of miscommunication, since I stressed that Strelkov left on his own", Borodai noted.
"It's libel against me and Strelkov", he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, in which Borodai was quoted as saying that he forcibly removed Strelkov to Russian territory.
According to the publication, Borodai stated that he was forced to tie-up his associate.

In March, Braydon Smith, a 23-year-old student, died from injuries received in the ring.
However, in the form in which boxing currently exists, these situations, where an athlete suffers a haemorrhage or a brain injury that results in death or serious injury, will continue to happen.
He spoke about this while addressing a session of the PA of the OSCE in Ulaanbaatar.
We judge these to be unacceptable actions, as an attack on the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
Let's return morality to politics.
Let's return dialogue and the law to the practice of international communication.
Let's return humanitarian ideals to the democratic world order.

World Champion in Track and Field, Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphant for the 24-year-old track and field athlete from Barnaul, Sergei Shubenkov.
Novye Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the past season.
Of course, right now, I will be training at home, in Barnaul, but being at home is still quite another situation.
You once said that autumn is your favourite time of year.
The end of August and beginning of September is a wonderful time.
The passions from the start of the main season have simmered down, and the weight of responsibility isn't so heavy.
Also, you know that your break is coming up soon...
Fatigue always starts to set in towards the end of the season.
And here, it's not important whether you won more or lost more.
Every competition is stressful.
You get physically and emotionally fatigued.
Sometimes.
Besides, you journalists won't let me forget about it either.
I can't say that there was anything particularly different.
I ran lots of cross-country, did exercises for overall physical conditioning, which included lifting and squats, and we built up my back muscles.
Then we moved onto hurdles training, and worked a lot on technique.
There was never a time when I was first running 13.20 and then would run 13.50.
I always work out my form gradually.
Do you remember your first world championships?
It was in Daegu.
I really wanted to make it into the finals back then; that was kind of the ultimate goal.
Two years later at the World Championships in Moscow, I had already made it into the finals with a better time.
I remember well how I felt before the final race: I really wanted to win the gold even back then!
How do you manage to build-up a decent speed and still not lose your head or tune-out?
I've noticed that when you aren't fixated on the end result, but on the process, it's a lot easier.
Honestly, it's well worth it.
Have you ever had those thoughts?
And I can't even imagine where I'd be without my coach; who needs me?
It might be nice to have slightly better conditions, but I try to be content with what I have.
Have you and Klevtsovy been together for a long time?
I started with sprinting, then long jump and triple jump.
At 14, I tried the hurdles and liked them.
With my very first race, I was able to qualify for the second adult category.
Have you ever been stricken with fear in front of the hurdles?
Somehow I was able to work things out with them right away.
But there is no way around this routine.
Thank you.
I quite enjoyed it myself.
Usually I don't re-watch my races, but with this one I couldn't hold myself back.
But you have to keep working on efficiency: there's always room for improvement.
As people say in situations like this: I will try to live up to expectations.
Since I've chosen to take this road, that means that I have to see it through to the end.
My coach loves to say: if you're not a weakling, you shouldn't feel any extra weight.
And I completely agree with him on this.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well I'm not so naïve as to have been stunned by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
All of my pseudo-friends, in an instant, in a second, vanished somewhere.
The total lack of support is a whole other matter.
I didn't really have any illusions, but now...
My best quality has always been self-sufficiency, so just try me.
But only idiots could give passports to degenerates like Fred Durst or Monson.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili didn't mince words when describing events in Crimea:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
I assume that the reference to how a tipsy Khrushchev attempted to sign something by no means fits into the overall picture of human society.
It's like visiting your neighbour and taking away his home...
The war started with the Kremlin, and it will only come to an end there.
I am almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, it started with a phone call from some bastard within the confines of the Kremlin.
I have a hunch who it might have been...
Kobzon doesn't have all that much longer to live.
Is he losing his apartment or something?
So, they took down his statue.
But now, reconciliation depends entirely on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to cover the leadership spill on Today Show
Nine's breakfast show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull's overthrow of Tony Abbott.
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.

Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Seven's The X Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
The first half-hour (5pm to 5.30pm) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5.30pm to 6pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to dent McGuire's show.
The final three agree Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as, apart from themselves, the best match for Wood.
"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
And asked who Wood should choose if not her, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday, 7.30pm on Ten.
Originally published as Sarah top choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.
But Tomsula showed faith in his man, giving Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.
Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.
Clashes between migrants and the police occur on the Hungarian border.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants are throwing stones at the police and trying to remove the fence that was placed at the border.
Reinforcements were sent to the scene of the clashes, and the police are taking measures to deal with the migrants' aggressive actions and their attempts to violate the border.
According to information from Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.

Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Sayansk plans to establish a 900-job facility.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a chemical industry centre and has well-developed infrastructure requiring systemic support.
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you begin your work as mayor?
One of the first practical steps was cutting the turnover time for documentation down to five days.
The city didn't have design and estimation documentation (DED) for even a single asset.
Without this, Sayansk couldn't participate in federal programmes.
We started with DEDs for the roads, childcare facilities, and the northern sewage and water line.
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Since September 1, childcare facility No. 10 has been closed for capital repairs designed to create 320 spaces.
Before now, the city had never received such funds.
In October, a 60-apartment building will be opened for orphaned children in Leningradsky microdistrict.
As far as construction is concerned, I will add that Sayansk is one of four cities in Irkutsk region that has been included in a programme to build economy-class housing.
All the required documentation has been prepared.
Construction of a 90-block section will commence soon.
Especially since the land underneath the facility is federal property.
Is the institute of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
Tangible support has been provided by enterprises such as: CJSC Vostok-Tsentr, Novo-Ziminskaya Thermal Power Plant, LLC Sayanski Broiler, and LLC PC MDF; the management of these enterprises responds to all of our requests.
We released a city chronicle and a book of Sayansk's poets.
The first builders and people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded with commemorative medals.
The first step was the purchase of musical instruments for talented young musicians.
The city doesn't have enough doctors or subject teachers.
We have a programme for the allocation of housing with the option to privatise it after five years.
Over the longer term, we will construct housing for public sector employees.
Most importantly, our city has a hard-working team with which I am able to solve the most complex issues.
It's critical to draw the right conclusions from each crisis, and life goes on.
The potential of Sayansk and of our region is great.
The document's author, a deputy from A Just Russia, Aleksandr Lomakin-Rumyantsev, also suggests carrying out an additional indexation on April 1, if the growth rate of the minimum living wage exceeds the rate of price increases on goods and services.
Under the current law, the indexation of social pensions takes place annually on April 1, in relation to the growth rate of the minimum living wage of pensioners in the Russian Federation over the previous year.
Head of the OSCE PA advises Mogherini of the impermissibility of the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.

NHC says 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach in announcing the donation drive on its blog.
I was lucky.
Google said it will match the first $5.5 million worth of donations globally at google.com/refugeerelief until it raises $11 million.

Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.
Robbers steal fur coats and 9 mln roubles from a house in Mytishchi.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked inhabitants of a Moscow region house and stole 9 mln roubles and three women's fur coats from them.
Interfax reported on this with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
According to experts, this is a very worrisome sign.
In the lead up to the world championship, the authorities need to urgently figure out how to accommodate all the city's guests.
It is already clear that not everyone will manage to do this: hoteliers are so apprehensive about the screening process that they frequently aren't even submitting request documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Saint Petersburg.
Currently, tourists can depend on 30,500 rooms in the city.
According to First Deputy of the Committee for the Development of Tourism, Nana Gvichiya, at the present moment, only 23 hotels have undergone classification: this is the number of inspections that have been conducted by the companies accredited in Saint Petersburg.
"Over the past six months, hotels have not been very interested in undergoing classification", admitted the Director of the Northwestern branch of the Russian Tourism Industry Union, Ekaterina Shadskaya.
The formulas, according to which prices will be set, will be published next year.
"I think there will be a 50% increase", explained President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
I don't know how well it fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than rampant price increases", he noted.
It's not clear what will happen with popular inexpensive hostels.
We really hope that this law is not adopted or that it won't apply to Saint Petersburg.
"We will defend our point of view, that hostels should be maintained", says Nana Gvachiya.
If the State Duma ends up approving the bill, then approximately 80% of the hostels in Saint Petersburg will be closed, and currently, they account for 1,500 rooms.
Mini-hotels also risk missing out during the world championship in football as a result of their own foot-dragging.
The reason for Saint Petersburg's delay is related in part to constant changes in the government's tourism unit, which has not be conducive to coordinated efforts.
Rented accommodations will also be very popular during the football championship.
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
For example, Leonid Garbar insists that Saint Petersburg has always been a welcoming city, where people not only provide you with directions, but might also take you on a mini-excursion.
Zhirinovsky "loses" Amur region.
He was doing these things when our generation was still learning how to sell newspapers, and remains in excellent form to this very day.
And then, from no reason, he starts attacking Rodina, and then, after the ruckus with the chairperson this time, he leads the fraction out of the meeting hall, while literally crying out: "All of you and your fronts are crooks and thieves".
In reality, Volfovich beautifully and elegantly lost Amur Region along with Abramov.
It's an entirely different matter that Abramov now finds himself in an odd position.
Only, the Abramov issue has been buried under itself.
It's beautiful really.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years
Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.
A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinist" wrote, in 1939, "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and the friends of the children's library in the city of Barnaul" grew stronger each day.
One time, Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her faraway friends in Barnaul a childhood photograph of her.
The library should be named after some nice children's writer, without political overtones!
The library staff sat down together, thought about it, and decided to leave things as they were.
"Krupskaya" is probably the most well-known and best-loved library in Barnaul, just like the Lenin Library in Moscow.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favourite theme of artist Olya Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager at a law firm; she came into work at eight and left at five, and only differed from the other managers in her love of drawing.
Then she found an online advertisement: "Book illustrator needed".
The book was written by a little American girl and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" ("My mama has cancer").
Olya did the illustrations and thought: life can end at any moment, and there won't be any miracles in it if you don't create them yourself.
Now she works at the library, illustrates the children's books of authors from around the world, and writes her own short stories.
But children who read visit us, and their parents understand the value of reading, the library's director, Tatiana Kushvid, tells Russian Planet.
In recent years, we've even felt a sense of confidence, that the children's library is needed, and that it will keep on going - the kids are coming here!
I think an interest in reading is making a comeback.
The library contains treasures: a pre-revolutionary collection of folk tales with the old letter "yat" and hard signs, stories by Korolenko in a supplement to the magazine "Niva", and a bound file of "Murzilka" magazines for 1936.
You can come to us so that everyone can read together, play together, and draw together.
We created a play area for young children: the child has only come to play, but their hand still reaches out for a book!
The library is always publishing booklets for parents that talk about what's going on in the world of children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to, and why.
Only children have this magical privilege.
The steps will creak with each step you take: it's a very old time machine.
Ellie still happily walks along the road paved with yellow bricks; lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals the magical matches; and Malchish Kibalchish still hasn't told the cursed bourgeouins the Military Secret, such is his solemn word.
These books are like passwords: you can use them to recognise your people anywhere.
There are also real literary rarities in the archive room: for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of folk tales with the old letter "yat" and hard signs.
Or stories by Korolenko in a well-known supplement to the magazine "Niva".
Or a bound file of "Murzilka" magazines for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, turning them a tea-like colour.
These publications aren't given out to library patrons anymore.
Now, I think: why did we all subscribe to this "Pioneers Truth"?
The pages of "Murzilka" have darkened with age.
Galina Vasilevna has been in-charge of the archive room her entire life.
She knows what colour Buratino's cap is, in which school year Harry Potter became captain for Gryffindor at the Quidditch championships, in which situations Carlson uses his motor silencer, and what Alisa Selezneva's father does for a living.
Only the most dedicated remain: educators, teachers, and servants of the cult of the book.
You can even tell who they are by their smile: it's said that this is a professional trait of a children's librarian.
Of course, I think that things were different in my childhood.
Back then, books were the most interesting and exciting thing that had ever happened to me.
And I wanted to work there, where everyone sits and reads.
And I'm delighted when our former library patrons bring in their children, and even their grandchildren...
Rumour Mill: No Celtic disharmony

Dons stretch lead over Celtic to five points
Griffiths plays down disharmony talk
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they are interested in.
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible.
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
Warburton wary of January transfers
The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The squad is doing really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.

Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The diehard Hibee was carpeted after admitting singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "Safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it is playing for Celtic."

McInnes glad to "win ugly" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to cling on desperately against Hamilton Accies to see out a seventh successive league win that moved them five points clear of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There's not a team out there who has won anything, whether it's cups or leagues, who haven't won games like that."
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
So why do it?
It would offer a unique perspective.
I cannot do that.
I like the guy.
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will just have to try to remember all the details.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.

I won't go over all the details again here.

Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the Canning River.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a safer tactic - "good police negotiation."
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."
They know it went on.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.
That really saddens me.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
It is a joke.
"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
Police have arrested a man over a hit-and-run collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
On Monday a 50-year-old Nathalia man handed himself in to police at Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident, failing to render assistance, and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old Cobram man, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting footy.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?
To me it's agendas.
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $200,000 to secure his release.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I'm proud of the Greek team, which fought until the final seconds".
Head Coach for Team Greece, Fotis Katsikaris, commended his team following the EuroBasket 2015 quarterfinal match against Spain (71-73).
It was a big game, AFP quotes Katsikaris as saying.
We were preparing for a great game by the Spaniards.
They fought until the final second.
Joel Freeland: "I will assume Kaun's duties in CSKA".
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer, and, of course, after I joined the team, R-Sport quotes Freeland. Essentially, I will assume the duties of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in terms of defensive formations and offensively in the key, and I think I can handle this.
There is a perception that someone has put a hex on the team.
Of course it's difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we show the best we are capable of, then we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague; I really think so.
I don't have any specific rituals before games; I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
According to the trainer, the face-to-face match between his previous and current teams will be far from ordinary.
I have nothing but fond memories associated with Rome.
The most important thing is to start the Champions League with a victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the team in the upcoming match.
I'm expecting the type of game from Roma that they played in the Serie A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that understands how to put the pressure on and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar has various attack options".
We'll still have to see how we will play against Krasnodar, Ural's official website quotes Skripchenko as saying.

Roger Cañas: "At home, Astana can score points off of anyone at all".
Following a 1st round match against Benfica (0-2) in the group stage of the Champions League, Astana midfielder, Roger Cañas, expressed confidence that his team would continue to improve the quality of its game in the future.
According to the midfielder, Astana players are capable of scoring points off of any opponent on their home field.
Benfica is in a higher class, but in a home game, I think we can count on scoring points off of them.
But first, we need to think about Galatasaray and Atletico.
At home games, we can score points off of anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll repeat this as often as necessary: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world".
The expert commended forward Cristiano Ronaldo who scored three goals.
The match wasn't easy, because Shakhtar knows how to use the ball, the UEFA's official website quotes Benitez as saying.
The opponents didn't have many chances, but their counterattacks always present a risk.
Cristiano Ronaldo reaffirmed his level.

Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.
Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He said he was doing it to lure them in.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was unhurt, but video of the fall went viral on social media.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.
That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.
It is nothing major.
This was just an accident.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never been done at Arsenal.

Di Maria scores to help PSG swat aside Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on," said Blanc.
It augurs well.
Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net.
However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.
That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share, which marked a 2.4-percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
Obama and Xi are expected to broach a range of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over China's alleged cyberespionage and its increasing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
The reckless driver who hit a biker on Kutuzovsky gets 2 years in prison.
Moscow's Dorogomilovsky Court has sentenced Deni Mirzoev who hit and killed a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Prospect in Moscow.
According to Russian News Service reports, Mirzoev received a sentence of two years imprisonment in a penal colony settlement.
The accident in question happened on May 22 at around three o'clock in the morning, near building No. 30 on Kutuzovsky Prospect.
Mirzoev was behind the wheel of a BMW vehicle that crossed into the oncoming lane of traffic and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
The man, who was born in 1989, died from his injuries at the scene of the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, bikers organised a motorcycle ride from Sparrow Hills to the City Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs at 38 Petrovka.
He behaved calmly and didn't commit any illegal acts; the police handed him over to emergency psychiatric care doctors.
Moscow news agency reports on this.
According to Andrei Galiakberov, Head of the press service for the City Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Moscow, the incident took place on Tuesday, September 15, at approximately 16:00 on Kashirskoe Highway.
A naked man entered the Church of St. Nicholas.
A police squad was called and arrived at the scene.
He turned out to be a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
Vladimir Yakushev signs more than 40 decisions and orders.
In particular, funds were dispensed for the purchase of a bus for a school in Nizhnetavdinsky district, and for capital repairs to the regional hospital in Kazansky district.
The Governor of Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
These are important issues, since investment projects need to work well and generate profit for the region.
The continued delivery of JSC MAZ passenger trucks and development of the JSC MAZ service centre, which was established in Tyumen at the JSC TPATP facility, were also talked about.
These issues also concerned the regional centre.
A meeting with the Governor of Omsk region is planned for the end of September.
The expanded consular district contains five federal subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called the original headquarters of the district.
The region is a testing ground for the launch of many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted their directing could "end up giving us something we don't want."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
Geoff said to me, "If I was going to be beat by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.
It's hard for the bullpen to throw every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.
After Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth, Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who singled up the middle for the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Kadyrov's original complaint regarding the book, "A Prayer to God", has been received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Court.
The original appeal by the Presidential Representative for Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognise the book, "A Prayer to God: It's meaning and place in Islam", as "extremist material", has been received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court, Interfax reports, with reference to the chairperson of the city court, Aleksandr Chukhrai.
The court is now waiting for possible objections from parties to the proceedings.
Chukhrai declined to comment on statements by several deputies from the Russian State Duma about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such stupidity themselves", he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision by Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognise the book as "extremist material".
An appeal from the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Prosecutor's Office was received Friday evening.
Specifically, the following quotes from the Koran were dubbed "extremist": "We worship You and we pray to You for help" and "Do not invoke anyone along with Allah".
Facebook will delete comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to delete posts and comments in which a negative assessment of migrants and refugees is given.
For example, in Germany today, all of the locations designated for accommodating refugees are already overcrowded.
In the near future, several cemeteries in the capital will be equipped with special areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first of them will be Butovskoye, Domodedovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemeteries.
The very first area for psychological rest has already appeared at Troyekurovskoye cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar areas will appear in other districts of the city.
The relaxation areas will look like small green spaces, reminiscent of parks.
Soon, relaxation areas will be built at Domodedovskoye, Butovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.
New cemeteries really could become barrier-free.
It bears noting that, over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 percent.
Lost mushroom picker is found in Elninsky woods after five days.
The poor mushroom picker was found thanks to the joint efforts of rescue workers and volunteers.
Aleksandr Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the woods."
There were even cynologists with dogs, but to no avail.
The man was only found after a helicopter joined the search efforts.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich went out into the woods, as per usual, to collect honey fungus and birch boletus mushrooms, but he hadn't returned by the evening.
On the fifth day, a helicopter from the fire-rescue centre joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group section of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said: "The helicopter was brought in and the man was found".
He had walked very far away, into a totally different area.
He travelled a huge distance for his age.
The mushroom picker was admitted to Elninsky Central District Hospital unconscious and in critical condition.
Paramedics diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as with severe dehydration and hypothermia.
Intravenous and antibacterial treatments.
While taking into account all of his chronic illnesses.
The pensioner, Vitaly Aleksandrovich, comes to Smolenshchina from Tambov region every year.
Aleksei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared the following: "The woods aren't far from the road; he's not really a local himself."
Obviously, he went a little too far and got lost.

Vesti Economy - Nobel Laureate: Globalisation
Eric Maksin.
To correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Chief Research Fellow at the International Laboratory of Decision Choice and Analysis at the National Research University, Higher School of Economics (NRU HSE), and 2007 Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics, Eric Maksin.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly more open.
"And these predictions have to a great extent come true", Maksin underscores.
However, not everything is so rosy.
It was expected that globalisation would narrow the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" in poor countries, which presents itself in the form of income inequality, or, to be more exact, wages.
Specific processes are at play in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maksin distinguishes four skill levels for specialists: A and B for wealthy countries, and C and D for poor ones.
Kremer and E. Maksin have proposed a remarkably beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
And, like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to an upsurge of empirical work in this field.
However, the workers themselves, the academic notes, don't have the money for this, and it's not profitable for companies to pay for their training.
Derbent: a living link with time.
Even though it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khaganate, and the Golden Horde.
The age of the oriental planes that grow in the courtyard of Derbent's Juma mosque equals several centuries.
A visitor to the mosque is poured aromatic tea and offered Dagestani delicacies: honey fig, persimmon, medlar, miracle flatbread, ayran, and sweets.
The inscription at the entrance to the Juma mosque says that the building was constructed in the 115th year of the Hijra.
That is, in the year 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
The interior dazzles in terms of scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and arches rest on square columns and are lit by sunlight streaming through miniature windows.
Keeping and breeding doves is a traditional pastime for residents of Derbent.
In order to defend against the ancient Persian enemies, the Caspian gates were blocked off by twin stone walls.
Construction of the city began with magals: neighbourhoods of single-story stone buildings.
For many years, the magals remained virtually unchanged.
In the old part of the city, parts of the aqueduct, built by the Persians approximately a thousand years ago, are preserved.
Derbent was one of the centres of the pottery trade.
The history of this amazing and risky artform dates back several centuries.
A new trend is seeing increasingly more girls amongst the tightrope walkers.

A business "game in the airport" takes place at Domodedovo.
To accomplish this, three airport models were built at Domodedovo.
The young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also maintained the airplanes.
"For failing to complete given tasks, they were penalised with a fine", explains the game's financial analyst, Dmitry Khilko, in an interview with the programme Vesti-Moskva.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely watching these events.
For them, this test is an effort to try out a new type of training.
They've already found a place for it in a secondary vocational education course.
Although, the students aren't really concerned about grand plans.
After three days of such training, it looks like they are in need of a day off.

The Green Tribunal turns out to be quick to judge.
We didn't provide you with a 110-page order for you to make a mockery of it, says Kumar.
If even just one more brick is put up, we will order that every existing building site be demolished.
Sometimes the court's decisions really are impossible to carry out within the judicially set timeframe, confirms Raj Panjwani, an environmental lawyer.
"Its main purpose is to shake up this system", the lawyer adds.
"People will lose their jobs", Kumar commented on his ruling.
However, similar explanations are by no means always met with understanding from ordinary people, whose lives could be changed by one stroke of the judicial pen.
But the most painful subject for the principled judge became the clean-up programme for the Ganges River, which was announced to great fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
Do you know what the word "sacred" means?
This is the river that we worship, but just look at what you do to it every day.
Every year, anywhere between 1.5 and 3 million of the 700 million Hindus that bathe in it die from infectious diseases.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country; nevertheless, they don't believe that the environment should be the cost of progress.
