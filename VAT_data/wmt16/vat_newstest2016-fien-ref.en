In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend
Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later picked up Lamb's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.
Police said the dog was OK.
"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together in the occasional gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
There was no sign of anything amiss.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no indication the two ever married.

UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
The next closest in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.
He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.

Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should've decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid."
While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.
"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.
However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.
On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do the best on honesty.

Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.

Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.
Here's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.
This we know.
Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.

Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.
Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury
Number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe behind rise
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out work in their home
Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Mrs Laury said she wants more women to be employed in B&Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex.
Currently the majority of staff are men.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "We still have a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move more towards a balance.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.

Delta State University shooter left note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.
Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to his resume posted on the university's website.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick.
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad tackle with two legs.

Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before.

'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.
To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.

Eight golden rules for living in student halls

The state stops the Y-train service to Karjaa - passengers resent this, “completely idiotic”
The Y-train service from Helsinki to Raasepori’s Karjaa will come to a halt in March.
There are changes in trains also elsewhere in Uusimaa.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be closed.
Siuntio resident Bengström sees the state's train cuts as short-sighted solution.
Some relief is coming.
There will probably be a new train for coastal line to replace the Y-train in Helsinki Regional Transport Authority’s (HSL) area, that is, to go as far as Kirkkonummi.
The prospective main line R-train will skip two stations.
Instead the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and a number of routes will stop across the country.
The ministry will stop buying train traffic services from the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to a Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Trains will be reduced on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.

The UN report on the civil war of 1983-2009 was unveiled on Wednesday after a long postponement.
There is no accurate information on the number of the victims.
According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forcing outsiders and children to fight.
The Wednesday's test in this autumn's matriculation examination was advanced foreign language, which for most is English.
Another option was to write a text of 150-200 words addressed to a person writing an online advice column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is equivalent to Finnish Leelian lepotuoli.
“This was the most difficult”, estimated Mia Lybeck, lecturer in English from Porvoo Swedish-speaking upper secondary school, about the third topic.

There were also some who took part in tests for advanced Russian (168 candidates), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).

The police is preparing to receive tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland.
The demonstration against the Government’s cut decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police forecast.
According to advance information, there can be even tens of thousands of people present.
Also police officers are expected to take part in the demonstration.
Those officers in duty are tasked with not only taking care of the emergencies and other police activities, but also securing the progress of the demonstration.
The streets leading to Railway Square are closed from motorised vehicles between about 9.30-14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From Hakaniemi direction the traffic is cut off from Kaisaniemi roundabout, from western direction beginning from Mannerheimintie.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam stretches from Hakaniemi to the nuclear centre.
Traffic standstills are to be expected from morning until the early evening.
The demonstration also cuts off the public transport in Helsinki.
From the police point of view this also has a positive side.
The problem with public transport flow that normally has to be considered in these kinds of crowd meetings will now partly take care of itself.
Police expects the demonstration to progress peacefully.
There are also local demonstrations organised around Finland on Friday.
The demonstration on Friday is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?

At the same time, the trade unions should take a look in the mirror.
Esko Aho's (Centre Party) government struggled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and employee organisations had never been as bad as during Aho's right-wing government.
And besides, Finland’s current government is the most right-wing ever, says Siisiäinen.
The current government coalition is interesting also in that way that it is so strictly right-wing, despite what the True Finns say.
There are all kinds of topics.
The demonstrators try to avoid damaging or destroying propers, says Siisiäinen.
The end of the 1990s brought new impetus, though.
The demonstration culture was changed.
The firemen strike of 1998 lasted for three months.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electricity strikes in the 1970s
70,000 metal workers took part in the strike.
The metal workers got a 16 percent raise.
Turning Point Thursday in 1993
The firemen were on strike for three months in 1998
Also the Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 moved the farmers to protest and burn bales of hay in front of the summit venue.
The nurses were on strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.
The Union of Health and Social Care Professionals (Tehy) threatened with a strike and nurses’ mass resignations in 2007.
The threat of mass resignations finally speeded up the negotiations to reach an outcome.
The doctors were on strike in 2001
After the strike the public sector gave doctors a raise.
The Central Criminal Police is investigating the background of the Finnish truck full of refugees for Austrian police
Those aboard the refrigerated truck are all in good condition.
The investigation is conducted and the main responsibility is in Austria, the location where this happened, says chief inspector Tero Haapala from the Central Criminal Police.
A refugee-beating captain, an ex-drug courier and an enormously rich business man - the story of five smugglers
In the book they present some of the tentacles of human smuggling, suggest possible solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of the trade.
I’ll beat them in their place immediately
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir - a chain-smoker captain and a father of six.
And that is what Emir has done with his blue, 10-metre, wooden boat for already hundreds of times.
If you cram the boat, you can fit 40 people in it.
After expenses, Emir makes about 8,000 euros for one trip.
Emir has five assistants who search customers for him from all over Tunisia.
After that the situation quietened down, until it was rekindled along with the refugee crisis.
Emir houses them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Sometimes there are rough seas, and when the waves are 20 metres high, the passenger cry and vomit.
Emir wants to be feared.
That is why he beats his customers and, at least allegedly, beats those who oppose him to death.
“I grabbed the customers by their necks, one by one, and threw them overboard”, Emir says in the book.
I’ll beat them in their place immediately.
They must be shown who’s the boss here right away.
Just another taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the start engine is already on its last legs, and the whole car has seen better days.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometres south-west from Belgrad.
Some are also housed in private apartments, but that is an open secret.
According to him, the Africans try to haggle.
Goran doesn’t like that.
I am not interested in money.
The distance is about 300 kilometres, most of it comfortably along the motorway.
Goran makes about 50,000 euros a year.
For a smuggler that is not a huge sum, but in Serbia it is a rather comfortable annual income.
Then he points the customers to the right direction and drives away.
Acts of kindness
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and that is not just a nick name.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary has a smuggling business that moves people from Congo to Europe.
For the Missionary, it is important to look good.
He has his shoes shined many times a day and takes care that the rubber band of his white underpants can be stylishly seen from under the low waistline of his jeans.
The Missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his ATV and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary is not preaching, he is organising people from Congo to Uganda and onwards to Europe.
He advises that you should be on the border in the morning, hide your money carefully and slip among the vendors crossing the border.
You get rid of the old identification card and get a new one to replace it.
Aluminium foil and icecubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, an ex drug courier.
The drive the motorway A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car in the motorway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
Tom doesn’t want that, he has already done seven years for drugs.
You have to be quiet in order to not wake up the drivers.
Sometime the driver is in on the plot, but the it’s more expensive.
When the way is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminium foil, the same kind that is used in the kitchen to wrap around a roast or a jacket potato.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice cubes for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers to the lorry and leaves the place hoping that the driver doesn’t notice the stowaways at least until they reach Britain.
The king of the smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s, and he has continually developed new methods for smuggling.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: luxury yachts are hired from Turkish harbours as if to take American or European families to pleasant tourist cruises for a couple of days.
Customers are kept in human storehouses, for instance in old industrial halls, until it is their time to go.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and to wait for a signal.
The customers have to stay hidden under the deck for the whole journey.
Food and drink are given, but the less the passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
After expenses, Küçük receives about 53,000 euros from a luxury yacht trip.
In the summer season there are at least hundreds of journeys, and Küçük makes millions.
It is believed that via a front-company, he has bought land, a pharmaceutical firm and over a hundred apartments he rents out.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same with a Turkey’s Democratic Party’s representative and a certain pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
American Olympic runner tells about her illness and becoming a prostitute in her book
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended her career in Sydney Olympics.
In the finals she panicked, though.
150 metres before the goal her strength ran out, however.
I felt like an idiot and thought I will never run again.
I forced myself to cross the goal line, says Favor Hamilton in her book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
Her brother Dan had committed a suicide a year before Sydney Olympics, and she was under terrible pressure to succeed.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was intrigued by the idea of receiving money from having sex with strange men.
She also persuaded her husband to approve her actions.
Favor Hamilton’s rate was 450 euros per hour.
She says she used the money in luxury life.
Later Favor Hamilton found out that she had bipolar disorder.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
She said she is happy the federation decided to discipline the ski rooster.
The argument between the ski federation of Norway and Northug is about money.
Last winter she was part of the team that won gold for relay in Falun.

Media researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told the reporters in the parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to estimate how recurrent these premier’s speeches broadcasted through television and radio are going to be.
According to Sipilä, the speeches will not necessarily always be broadcast from Yle channels.
Tonight we are using this channel, Sipilä said.
That is why we chose this channel, explained Sipilä.
The speech will be broadcast between 9.05 and 9.20 PM both via TV1 and Radio Suomi.
It is also available in Yle Areena.
Sipilä is taking a big risk
In the name of democratic discussion and publicity I hope that these matters are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be odd, if the media would not react.
According to Koivunen, a televised speech is a big risk for Sipilä.
Sipilä should introduce something new and special in his speech, in order to fulfill the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
A smart move from Sipilä
In Sipilä's forthcoming speech important will also be what the Prime Minister leaves unsaid, emphasises the media researcher.
Research coordinator of University of Jyväskylä, Heikki Kuutti, says that one should pay special attention to what Sipilä discusses and what he will not.
Sipilä overrides the media and addresses the people directly.
According to Kuutti it is vital how Sipilä presents himself in the television - is he sweating, are his hands shaking.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure, who is now telling the people what to they need to do.
If Sipilä can put his points well, it can work.
Quite exceptional
Parliamentary researcher Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister’s speech to the citizens is quite exceptional.
According to him, it is something that has not taken place in decades - that the Prime Minister directly addresses the people.
Exceptional times require exceptional measures, Railo says.
The Left Alliance leader Paavo Arhinmäki said via Twitter that Sipilä could make his speech about the situation of the nation also in the parliament as a Prime Minister’s announcement, which would allow for discussion.
There is no time for monologues.
One cannot hide for ever, Rinne writes via Twitter.

Makwan Amirkhani gave an important speech against young people’s street fights.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to check out one Instagram account.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed with this fad of young people.
26-Year-old Amirkhani has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys are kicking those on the ground, sitting on top of someone and hitting frantically without any thoughts for consequences, what will happen when you do these kinds of videos, grieves Amirkhani.
Some of the young people on the video are immigrants.
Amirkhani reminds people that there are Finnish websites that look for crimes committed by immigrants.
Amirkhani urges the young to remember the people close to them.
Amirkhani says that violent actions give ammunition to racism.
You create that kind of hate in me that I don’t like myself.
SAK sits on its view about the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK proposal on Twitter.
Akava President Sture Fjäder believes that the Government will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava all stand behind it.
That would require though that the biggest labour organisation SAK softens its earlier opinion.
As for SAK President Lauri Lyly, he commented the matter briefly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK work committee will discuss the matter on Monday.
Lyly reminds people that SAK did not accept Prime Minister Sipilä’s Government’s proposal for social contract.
Comment: Great demonstration at risk of flopping - “It does feel a bit funny to shake your fist”
It does feel a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The Trade Union of Education OAJ threatened to close schools and nurseries.
On Wednesday the Chairman of Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees STTK, Antti Palola (Social Democrats), appeared in public in a placatory way.
Akava Presiden Sture Fjäder (Coalition) immediately rushed to inform that his reconciliation paper is already ready.
At first the SAK office did not utter a word.
Coincidence or not, but Palola’s outing did take some wind out the sails of those stopping Finland, the figurehead of which is AKT's Marko Piirainen (Social Democrats).
It does feel a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited 6.00 p.m.: Added information about Lyly’s comments.
This cannot happen again, emphasised Naryshkin according to news agency Interfax.
Lukko is about to meet a true playoff monster: “Goals will be tight”
Tappara and Lukko continue their hard work in Hakametsä today, when both teams are under fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no real scoring party in Hakametsä today.
Tappara visited Kuopio yesterday and drilled a 3-2 extra time win over KalPa.
That was a manly climb, since the last season’s silver team was lagging two goals behind at the worst.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare to the team from Rauma.
There are no big changes in the line-ups of the teams, except goalkeepers.
Mika Noronen from Tappara’s goal makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski between Lukko’s goalposts.
Point of view: A lousy play underway in Ässät
Sports Director Toivola scripted a sequel unsuitable for Head Coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a script to Rocky, in which he starred himself.
Sensationally the underdog stood up to heavyweight world champion, Apollo Creed.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola scripted a restless Cinderella story to Pori.
The team was full of Rocky-like nameless but tenacious underdogs.
Valkoinen intiaani, Porin Matti and Pele Peltonen were some of the names.
For the playoffs, the players dyed their hair red and cut it to a Mohawk hairdo.
Toivola turned blonde.
Ässät won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The scriptwriter Toivola believes that this season's new work will function the same way as ten years ago.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have thrashed blokes in the rink like Rocky thrashed pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen all have their merits outside puck handling.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, main part is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Rautakallio Sean Connery.
There is nothing Rocky in Rautakallio besides his nickname.
Rautakallio’s game philosophy does not include rushing or minor clamouring.
Last season, Garret Stafford from Ässät checked Jere Karjalainen from Tappara to the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the referees, but Rautakallio removed him from the play.
I do not approve that kind of play, and it is not part of team Ässät hockey, snarled Rautakallio annoyed after the game for Satakunnan Kansa.
The Ässät team for the season is weirdly constructed.
It is no wonder then that the Head Coach has complained about the lack of skills.
How much have you been able to affect the player selections, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season affect the selection and, unfortunately, the situation at the player market was quite limited, Rautakallio answes diplomatically.
Simmering beneath the surface.
Rautakallio, a 1953 model, is, as far as is known, interested in transferring to Toivola's post as a Sports Director.
Toivola should have opted out of writing the script for the sequel.
Olga Temonen to play Sipe Santapukki’s mother
Yes, in the film I will play the role of my husband’s friend’s mother.
Her role in the film protraying the early years of Apulanta, Teit meistä kauniin, is drummer Sipe Santapukki’s mother Sirkka.
Sirkka encourages and supports his son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
She is a great person and I am grateful for Tuukka for entrusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirkka already before the film project, but after that the pair has become considerably closer.
Sirkka has been a great help.
Sirkka luckily also understands that drama is drama and the truth might have to be coloured in a bit.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola to blindly believe that Apulanta will be the biggest band in Finland.
At most she could have secretly taken to him.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the whole production crew will spend a month in Heinola filming.
We are taking over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us really warmly, just asking which streets should be emptied and when.
Iron Sky 2 is now the most expensive non-animated Finnish film
The budget for Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
The shooting of the film will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins shooting Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Previously it was Jalmari Helander’s Big Game that had the title for the most expensive film in Finland.
The shooting of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, begins in October in AED Studios’ facility near Antwerp and will last for eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola leaves for Belgium already next week.
I've been really amazingly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script, since I know exactly what the film should be like.
Now everything is so tight that there is no slack anywhere.
The action film stars for example Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Dork or cool?
Big logos make a return to shirts
A while ago a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like they avoided Crocs.
First came norm core trend, or regular fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favouring as boring as possible basic clothes as if as a way to separate themselves from the masses.
The bigger and more traditional the better.
In addition to logos, also for example the recognisable Adidas stripes, jerseys of your favourite team and New York Yankees baseball caps have made a return to street fashion.
For example the chest of Versace's autumn shirts makes the brand of the garment quite obvious.
Would you be prepared to showcase logos in your clothing?
Russian politician published proof: I did not get stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
Let us start with me not going inside a battle tank, since it was an infantry fighting vehicle BMP-3.
I went inside, took a look around and calmly exited, Zatov stated to Komsomolskaya Pravda.
That is why I was interested what is inside the vehicles, I was admiring our technology.
And I exited through the rear hatch, he said.
And I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the infantry fighting vehicles also in the next expo, promised Zotov.
One idiot wrote, everyone else repeated.
I am tall and robust, but nothing like me getting stuck in a tank did not happen, he said to radio Russkaya sluzhba novostei.
Here is the favourite object of interior design bloggers
The candleholder designed by architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen from 1962 still looks like it was designed today.
The cubical steel frame is like a work of art, and that is what it originally was, too.
The architect brothers are known to polish the candleholder shape for a long time and with mathematical precision.
Initially it was only presented to the gentlemen’s esteemed dinner guests.
Kubus candleholder is made by family business By Lassen, who uphold the design tradition of the famous brothers.
Lately it has been the favourite object of especially interior design bloggers.

A leakage in Kittilä mine operated by a Canadian-based mining company Agnico Eagle Finland
The gold mine’s treated process water has been leaking from the so called tailing pond to a trench.
According to the company, measures to repair the leak have been taken.
The pond contains neutralised ore-processing sand and treated process water from the flotation process.
Usually the water is either pumped to be used again as a process water or conveyed through an overland flow field to the environment, as specified in the permit.
According to the company, the leak water quality complies with the current permit conditions.
The leak was discovered during an inspection round on Monday morning.
Danske’s Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against too many cuts
Today the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its country report for Finland, and it is mainly in line with the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to apply comprehensive structural reforms in order to overcome economic problems.
According to Danske Bank chief economist, Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is a consensus on structural reforms, but also some differences.
These include, for example, investments on infrastructure, Kuoppamäki told to Taloussanomat.
In their new economic outlook, Danske expects the growth this year will remain at zero per cent.
This morning, Statistics Finland said the total production was slightly growing during the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
The difference is, however, only some decimals of a per cent.

Muslim boy arrested in Texas school - teacher thought a self-made clock a bomb
The police has the clock, but as far as is known, it contained a circuit board and a digital display with wires in between.
His father is furious about the incident, and the country’s Council of American-Islamic Relations is wondering, whether the case is yet another display of islamophobia in the United States.
This has offended the people, suspected Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview by BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined in in the singing.

Models rarely have a place of their own to call home.
The work is constant travelling, and it can mean even an entire year of living out of hotels and apartments, where the fashion houses accommodate their models.
Getting a job is constant risky game.
During the fashion week, models and designers are together the whole time and, at the same time, serve as a support system.
Models choose this job for the opportunities it affords them, but it rankles them that everybody thinks the work is just presenting clothes.
Models yesterday in Tory Burch show.
New York Fashion Week is under way, with designers revealing their next year's collections.
Roope Salminen had a change of style to play the role of the least known Apulanta musician in a film
Roope Salminen will play the role of the founding member of Apulanta, Antti Lautala, in the film based on the early years of the band.
Lautala started Apulanta in 1991 together with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
This is quite a challenge to me, since I’m a rap artist of nearly 26 years, and in the film I’m a 16-year-old guitarist, laughs Salminen.
I haven’t wanted to meet the real Antti before shooting, since I want to make my own interpretation of him.
I don’t want to make an imitation of a person.
The head of Roope Salminen ja Koirat band does not have to play the role starting from a scratch.
According to Salminen, punk mannerisms come naturally to him.
Teppo Manner will be drummer Sipe Santapukki, Tatu Sinisalo is singer Toni Wirtanen, and Iiro Panula is bassist Tuukka Temonen.
Earlier seen sporting a moustache and a soul patch, now Roope has smoothly shaven cheeks and he has dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how to tell children about refugees
The fact is that not all the people in the world are well-off.

You can still be a good parent for your child.
Pallosalama striking Vermo is hard to control
Perttu Pohjola managed to coach Apilan Pallosalama into a fierce condition in the midsummer.
It trotted only first and second places, until it collapsed in the end of July in Tampere harness race.
The explanation for exhaustion was found after a viewing.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest possible, but required two courses of medication before it was conquered.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be restricted to light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised about the horse’s last run.
The trainer supposes that a proper competition did the stallion good.
Instead on a good day the stallion has had such a lightning spurt that the competitors have been amazed.
Pohjola hopes for a slipstream run at Vermo.
This is why you cannot get rid of useless iPhone applications
According to Cook, removing Apple applications is a more complex issue than it first appears.
In July the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so called core inflation was down to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat’s preliminary estimate for core inflation was 1.0 per cent.
In July the growth was 0.1 per cent.
And as for the decline in the financial markets, it will begin before the next recession.
It is evident that both the economy and the financial markets are now weaker to withstand a rate hike than ever before since the 1950s.
The leaders deciding on Fed's monetary policy and its prevailing setting have during last summer and early autumn hinted that the time might be ripe to raise the rates.
They report Fed's rate hikes and their economic and financial impacts since the 1950s.
The increase in prices in the financial markets has ended within a year or two after Fed interest hikes have begun.
The strategists remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
They were patching the marks left by the techno bubble and at the same time stoking up the next.
The so far largest debt bubble in the economic history was created.
3) The madly cheap debt funding, packed especially to financial economy almost without restraints, inflated the largest rate bubbles in the so far economic history for most of the sectors of financial markets, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
Neither the financial structures set up with debt leverage nor evaluation bubbles did last but a certain time after the rate hikes had begun and the costs of debt funding had started to rise.
The risks were materialised as a financial crisis, and a great recession followed.
A bigger bubble and more debt
3) The liquidity from the central banks that has started off cheaper and more fast-flowing than before has mostly stayed at the financial markets and has dragged the key types of securities and properties to their highest peak since before the financial crisis or ever.
Maybe the outlook of Albert Edwards, a strategist from a French bank Societe Generale, is not as weird as it may seem at a first glance.
Computer and printer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard (HP) plans to shed up to 33,000 jobs.
The main part of the cuts will be targeted to the enterprise services business, says the company.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will cut 25,000-30,000 jobs.

Yle: Minister Berner on board of tax haven firm
According to the Luxembourg register of companies she still remains on the board.
Member after a merger
Kährs is a flooring company who merged with the Finnish flooring company Karelia-Upofloor already in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor between 2010 and 2013, and after the merger she served on board of Kährs as well as the company from Luxembourg.
According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings go through a complicated ownership structure in Luxembourg.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have served on board of Karelia-Upofloor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner in cooperation, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
Berner said to Yle that there is no tax planning involved in Hartwall Capital ownerships.
First company-run reception centre opens in Espoo
The first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers opens in Otaniemi district of Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to welcome the first hundred occupants already today from 6 PM onwards.
The Finnish Immigration Service sets up the reception centre on the facilities of a former emergency services college.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree together for instance on the security arrangements of the centre.
STTK is preparing an optional competitiveness package
According to the chairman, Antti Palola, at this moment their attention is on this Friday’s demonstration.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) has no readiness for discussions.
Palola: Constructive dialogue
Palola did not take a stand on whether the schedule is realistic or not.
Commendations from Akava’s Fjäder
Akava President Sture Fjäder acknowledges STTK’s announcement about preparing an alternative package.
Fjäder hopes that also SAK takes part in the alternative package, because without SAK, the package is not inclusive enough.
Antti Palola’s STTK said earlier on Wednesday that new proposals are being drafted.
We want change security and working time banks.
In return we want change security and working time banks, say the President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that also SAK would think on similar terms with Akava, like STTK already did on Wednesday.
“Same boat, common goal, voluntary work” - play bingo while Sipilä speaks tonight
The Green Left in the University of Tampere
After that, the President and the ministers gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
Soliloquy, monarchist pursuit
During the whole day, Sipilä’s speech has invited criticism and guesses about what is to come.
The Left Alliance leader Paavo Arhinmäki said via Twitter that “Sipilä could make his speech about the situation of the nation also in the parliament as a Prime Minister’s announcement, which would allow for discussion.”
We have tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
According to the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions, SAK, it will be commented live by the SAK President Lauri Lyly and the Director General of the Confederation of Finnish Industries Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticised for broadcasting Sipilä’s speech.
The speech has also provoked taunts.
Mother changes into a prettier frock and father puts a tie around his neck.
At nine o’clock the family then quietens down in front of the television, as if a TV series family of yore”, writes blogger Saku Timonen.
It has published the herewith bingo in Facebook.
Ahtisaari for the Guardian: The West ignored Russian offer to have al-Assad step aside
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador for the UN laid out a plan, which included having al-Assad elegantly cede power after some time.
I know Churkin.
I explained what I was doing there and he said: “Martti, sit down and I’ll tell you what we should do”, Ahtisaari recalls in the Guardian interview.
Ahtisaari says he passed Churkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
According to Jenkins, he would have even then suspected that it was a Putin trick to keep an al-Assad supporter in power.
The flow of refugees is our own doing
This flow of refugees to Europe is our own doing.
We are now paying the bills we have caused ourselves, states Ahtisaari to the newspaper.
Asylum seeker registration centre possibly to Tornio
Government-planned asylum seeker registration centre to Northern Finland will most likely be established to Tornio.
The centre is planned to be set up in an empty Tornio yhteislyseo school building in the town centre.
According to the vice-chair of Tornio town council, Sauli Hyöppinen (Left) this is not true.
Based on this, the decision can be expected to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to the Mayor, Timo Nousiainen, the town received a contact about the matter on Monday, and they were quick to react.
An expert has checked that the building could be suitable for this kind of use.
The location is about 200 metres from the border, so it would be functional also in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still hopes the labour market to present an option for tightening conditions
Sipilä told the journalists in the parliament that he has not been in contact with the labour market organisations.
According to Sipilä, the organisations’ proposals should be available before this.
But even this is not the final deadline.
These things do not take long if there is a will, worded Sipilä.
The list published last week by the Government includes for example changing Epiphany and Ascension Day into unpaid days off without shortening annual working hours.
Tohmajärvi council approved sap hall warehouse expansion
Tohmajärvi council unanimously, but slightly grudgingly, approved the Nordic Koivu Ltd. hall, also known as the sap hall, warehouse expansion.
The municipality has no risk, because the company will pay for the investment as rent, reasoned Vesa Väistö (Finns party).
A place also for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city board toned down its previous intransigent position on bringing street name signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The language spoken in the Joensuu area is more part of the eastern Savonian dialects.
The city recommends the same attitude for all the other operators, as well.
These both can well be utilised in various marketing in the region.
And this again has an effect on whether it is even possible to live and work here, wonders the mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen.
He also highlights the air travel, the continuation of which has several times been at issue.
The effect of reducing these connections on for example the employment situation should be discussed, emphasises Karjalainen.
Joensuu city executive board ostensibly agree on provincial ‘Siun sote’ project, but one discordant note could be heard.
A member of the board, Pentti Keskisalo (Social Democrats, in the picture) mooted to abandon the whole project at a board meeting on Monday, but his motion was dismissed as it was not supported.
The board agreed on a draft decision by mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed in the beginning of October before the meeting of the executive board that will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all the other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola discontinued next year
There will be passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola also in the future, albeit one train pair less frequently.
Next March will see changes in passenger trains between Kotka and Kouvola.
One train pair is discontinued, but the trains still run five times a day from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cutbacks are due to the state’s austerity measures.
The Ministry of Traffic and Communications’ train traffic purchase money for the next four years is cut back 12.3 million euros.
The rescue department helped the 12-year-old who climbed to the roof and then could not get down off the hook.
The situation arose at Ketotie street in the district of Tornionmäki around 5.30 PM on Tuesday evening.

FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
Looming over them at one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.
There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.
Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop, offering an dizzying array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive section if you need to pick up some motor oil.
The store is massive, and it will take over an hour to comb through all the aisles.
If all that shopping makes you hungry, grab a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store's indoor food stall (good, inexpensive) is near the registers, and has various takeout options.
What it stocks: Need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet fish, and even fry it for you if you'd like.
A good portion of the store is given over to the massive freezer section, where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork casings, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially-prepared foods and more.
The wide aisles accommodate both shopping carts and forklifts.
The find: Fresh monthong durian next to the checkout stand.
Parking: LAX-C has its own lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can get busy, parking is usually not hard to find.

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Seven had mixed fortunes on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (5pm to 5.30pm) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5.30pm to 6pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.

The final three agree Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.
However when asked the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's final rose?," their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as, apart from themselves, the best match for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
"Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn't just a game - I'm wholeheartedly invested in him now," she said.
"I don't know if I can say," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.

Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday's 20-3 win against Minnesota.
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.
Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.
"It was just one of those things, you just worry about the next play and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful
Weight loss operations, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.
In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
At the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved larger drops in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).
Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.
Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.
A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been very lethal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.

Man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
The Canning Vale constable remained dry as he coaxed the man from the Canning River.
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a safer tactic - "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.

Cobram hit-and-run driver arrested
Police have arrested a man over a hit-and-run collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the weekend.
On Monday a 50-year-old Nathalia man handed himself in to police at Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident, failing to render assistance, and other traffic offences.
Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.
He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
Serbian man gets $200k bail on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland has been granted bail on a $200,000 surety.
Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.
On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying.
But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.
Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date.

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.
"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
It is nothing major.
It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation is king.
And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.
The old adage of "getting on with it" is strong, as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems."
And so, if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with the sets fully redesigned in celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better still, if in Starbucks you see someone alone, give a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest

Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
It augurs well.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.
However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed.
But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
It was a magnificent match from them.

"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Pro-rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior Monday night taking home the $1 million grand prize.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
So to all of a sudden...like I can't even imagine what it's going to be like...the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course, won't be awarded any prize money.
By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.
He's such a great guy, and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.
"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.
"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.
It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.
Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes in the early going.
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who singled up the middle for the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit it particularly well, but he got it in the right spot.
Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.
The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
